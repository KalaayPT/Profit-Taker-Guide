The fight has three major repeating phases and has a 5-minute time limit towards the end.</p><p>The three major phases of the fight are as follows:</p><h2 id="shield-phase" tabindex="-1"><strong>Shield Phase</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#shield-phase" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Shield Phase**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>During the Shield Phase, a glowing damage type symbol appears above the Profit-Taker&#39;s forehead. Only damage with the corresponding element can harm the shields. Once enough damage is dealt, the shield will cycle to another vulnerable element. If the shield does not take enough damage, it will automatically cycle after 25 seconds. Alternatively, if 5 seconds have passed since the shield last changed, you can manually cycle it by using void damage. The Shield Phase usually ends after clearing 5 elements.</p><h2 id="armor-phase" tabindex="-1"><strong>Armor Phase</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#armor-phase" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Armor Phase**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>After each Shield Phase, Profit-Taker enters the Armor Phase. In this phase, you break Profit-Taker’s limbs, wait for a 2-second animation, then damage her body. Only Arch-guns can damage her during this time. After the fourth Armor Phase, Profit-Taker dies.</p><h2 id="pylon-phase" tabindex="-1"><strong>Pylon Phase</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#pylon-phase" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Pylon Phase**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Following the first and third Armor Phases, the Profit-Taker enters the Pylon Phase. During this phase, Profit-Taker sends out 4 or 6 Pylons that must be destroyed before moving on to the next phase. The Pylons will land in random places around Profit-Taker and they have shield bubbles that you cannot shoot through surrounding them. The traditional way to break these is by entering the bubble, at which point you can destroy the Pylons as normal.</p><h2 id="phase-order" tabindex="-1"><strong>Phase Order</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#phase-order" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Phase Order**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The different phases occur in the following order:<br> Shield→ Armor → Pylon→ Armor → Shield → Armor → Pylon → Shield → Armor → Death</p><h2 id="random-enemies" tabindex="-1"><strong>Random Enemies</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#random-enemies" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Random Enemies**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>During all phases, enemies will spawn that deal a lot of damage and will easily kill you. These enemies are called “adds” by the community. They might be easy to overlook, but if you’re just getting into Profit-Taker, there’s a good chance that more than half of your deaths in the fight so far are caused by adds.</p><p>The simple solution is to <strong>kill the Alert Beacons</strong> that some of the enemies will set up. If you allow the beacons to remain, stronger enemies will spawn and their level will increase. Spending a second to kill a Beacon is well worth avoiding dying a minute later in the fight.</p><div style="width:10%;text-align:left;"><img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/alert_beacon.png" alt="alert_beacon" style="width:100%;height:auto;"></div>',16)]))}const p=a(n,[["render",s]]);export{c as __pageData,p as default};
