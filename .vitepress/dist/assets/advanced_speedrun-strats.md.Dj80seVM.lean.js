You can take advantage of this to get a better angle at the rear legs by leaving the elevator just a half second to a second after PT spawns (a bit after 8s on the ingame timer). This makes leg phase overall more consistent for fast runners, and minimizes the effect of the <a href="/miscellaneous/bugs.html#animation-bug"><strong>animation bug</strong></a>.</p><h2 id="on-call-strats" tabindex="-1"><strong>On Call Strats</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#on-call-strats" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**On Call Strats**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>On Call Crew is an extremely powerful tool for covering elements that essentially lets you have three weapons attacking shields at a time. This removes the need to switch weapons, and opens up the primary weapon slot for pure pylon damage.</p><p>On Call Crew requires you to run Total Eclipse, so they can profit from the damage buff as their damage without said buff is noticeably weak.</p><p>Ideally, Crewmate should be thrown straight at the ground while landing. This removes the need to wait for them to teleport, allowing them to start clearing shields immediately.</p><p>The ideal stat distribution for On Call is 00555 (5 Repair, 5 Combat, 5 Endurance). However this is extremely rare, so certain stats can be prioritized. The combat stat gives the Crewmate a base damage buff, making it top priority. Repair and endurance are for health regeneration and additional health, respectively. If you have problems with your crewmate dying prematurely during your runs, prioritize investing in the repair stat. Only elite Crewmates, unlocked at rank 10 Command Intrinsic, can reach this, as they start with 2 more base stats than normal Crewmates.</p><p>If you have an elite Crewmate, you ideally want one with the 150% primary critical chance (or 150% secondary if using Catabolyst) bonus, as it opens up a mod slot on the build. An elite Crewmate isn’t necessary, however.</p><p>The modern weapon of choice is <a href="/advanced/solo-speedrun-builds.html#crewmate-torid"><strong>Torid</strong></a>, as it leaves toxin clouds that consistently damage Profit Taker, meaning your crewmate doesn’t have to target Profit Taker the moment it’s toxin shield, they just have to have shot at Profit Taker recently.
