The Zaw is one of the easiest weapons to set and forget for Profit-Taker while having some of the most complicated mechanics. These mechanics are incredibly important if you want to understand why the recommended Zaw is the way it is. <a href="/beginner/creating-builds.html#zaw-part-setups"><strong>For custom zaw parts and builds see the weapon builds section.</strong></a></p><p>For clarity, in this section <strong>throw</strong> means the button combination required for contagion, while the <strong>launch</strong> is when the contagion projectile appears from your zaw after you throw. This is important because contagion doesn’t launch at the same time as you throw.</p><h3 id="throwing-contagion" tabindex="-1"><strong>Throwing Contagion</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#throwing-contagion" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Throwing Contagion**&quot;">​</a></h3><p>There are a few ways to throw contagion, the traditional way to throw contagion for Profit-Taker is by double jumping, though there are a few ways to use bullet jump too. Bullet jump may be easier for people using a controller. A little note is that contagion doesn&#39;t care about what your current animation is, it only cares about the physical inputs.</p><p>When using double jump for contagion, many people bind jump to the scroll wheel to jump <strong>extremely quickly</strong>. The exact timing on how long to scroll for the double jump is FPS dependent, lower fps means you’ll have to scroll slower for the game to register the second jump. For most Zaw types, using scroll wheel is a bit excessive for merely throwing contagion, as Warframe limits the rate at which you can throw contagion to as fast as the contagion projectile can appear. Due to this, you may find yourself having to slow yourself down in order to throw reliably. The reason you’d want to use the scroll wheel over the spacebar is a technique where you ‘weave’ your gun in between contagion throws, reducing the cooldown from throwing contagion, and massively speeding up shield phases even if you have to swap weapons. The increased speed from the scroll wheel makes this weaving more practical.</p><p>It is possible to use bullet jump for contagion in Profit-Taker, but it easily ruins your positioning and is difficult to weave with. You need to move backward constantly to avoid getting out of position, and this leaves little time to shoot.</p><h3 id="melee-mechanics" tabindex="-1"><strong>Melee Mechanics</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#melee-mechanics" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Melee Mechanics**&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Besides the obvious stat differences between the various combinations of strikes and hilts, there are some important differences between the different <em>types</em> of melee weapons you can choose for your Zaw.  These differences can be mainly boiled down to two things; Air Lock, how long you get held midair while swinging melee; and Projectile Release, which is simply when in the animation contagion gets launched. To understand how they work you need to understand the different parts of an aerial melee attack.</p><p>An aerial melee attack has three parts: wind-up, swing, and wind-down.</p><p>During the wind-up, the melee is ‘readied’ as it moves from the idle animation to where it will start the swing.</p><p>Once it is in position, it will enter the swing. This is when you get the visual effect behind the blade. This animation cannot be canceled by shooting.</p><p>Once the swing has finished, the melee returns to the idle animation in the wind-down.</p><p>When you melee while aim gliding (like you need to for contagion) you get ‘locked’ at your current height during every frame of the melee animation, this is known as Air Lock. Wind-up, swing, and wind-down all scale with attack speed, however, certain melee types take noticeably longer to complete certain parts of the animation, and the scaling appears to be uneven.</p><div style="width:50%;text-align:left;"><img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/meleetimingsidk.png" alt="meleetimingsidk" style="width:100%;height:auto;"></div><p><em>This swing scales more with attack speed than wind-up or wind-down do.</em></p><p>Melees with high wind-up, swing, or wind-down durations are the weapons that are most often referred to as having Air Lock, however, all zaws experience it. Air Lock is the deciding factor for many people when choosing what zaw type to use. The duration of the various parts of the animation cannot be directly linked to the aerial attack archetype, as certain parts of the animation can be dramatically different between two types in the same archetype (like swords and scythes). If you cancel the melee animation (most commonly done by firing your weapon, though emotes and some abilities do this as well, and usually faster than just firing your weapon) it will break the lock.</p><p>With no attack speed buffs or mods, Contagion is launched at either the start or the end of the swing. The point at which contagion launches for weapons that throw at the end of the swing does not scale with attack speed, however, the point at the beginning of the swing does. If you animation cancel the wind-up, all weapons throw after a certain delay. A new contagion projectile can only be launched after the previous one appears, so weapons that launch at the beginning of the swing can throw contagion at a higher rate, hence Balla (dagger) is considered to be the fastest zaw to throw with. However, these weapons also launch contagion from a different position.</p><p>Several weapon types share aerial attacks and idle animations, with variances in base swing speed, wind up, and wind down. The aerial attack archetypes are as follows:</p><p><u><strong>Spin</strong></u></p><p>Weapon type: Dagger</p><p>This archetype is specific to Daggers. It has a fast wind-up and swing while having a slow wind-down. When animation canceling by shooting Diplos or using emotes, this archetype is the fastest in terms of cooldown, allowing you to throw contagion more often than basically any other archetype. This is the current meta as of writing this portion.</p><p>Notes:</p><p>Contagion is launched at the start of the swing, when combined with their low wind-up time this makes dagger zaws the fastest in terms of damaging Profit-Taker near the start of shield phases. This is especially notable for the first shield, though it doesn&#39;t make a massive difference. Due to the extremely long wind-down duration, animation cancel is necessary for Daggers to compete with low Air Lock weapons.</p><p><u><strong>Slap</strong></u></p><p>Weapon types: Staff, Polearm.</p><p>This archetype is characterized by minimal wind-up and wind-down with a fast swing. The idle animation is the closest of any archetype to where the swing starts for these weapons and they return to idle incredibly quickly, making them the weapon of choice for many.</p><p>Notes:</p><p>Polearms have a slightly longer swing than staves.</p><p>Air lock is nearly unnoticeable, even with the slightly longer swing on polearms.</p><p>Contagion launches at the end or after the swing.</p><p>This archetype is recommended for all strikes that can get it.</p><p><u><strong>Underhand</strong></u></p><p>Weapon types: Heavy Blade, Hammer</p><p>This archetype is characterized by having high wind-up and extremely high wind-down time. The idle animation is very far from where the swing begins, and the swing ends extremely far from idle. This makes weapons of this archetype feel unwieldy to use.</p><p>Notes:</p><p>The extremely high wind-up and wind-down times make for a punishingly long air lock duration (among the highest) thus, animation cancel is extremely important when using a Heavy Blade or a Hammer in a run.</p><p>Contagion is thrown at the beginning of the swing. To take advantage of this, make sure to animation cancel during the swing animation.</p><p><u><strong>Overhand</strong></u></p><p>Weapon types: Machete, Sword, Scythe</p><p>This archetype is characterized by generally low wind-up, swing, and wind-down speed, along with a notable variation between the discrete types. The idle animation is moderately far from the start of the swing, with the swing ending fairly close to idle.</p><p>Notes:</p><p>Contagion is launched at the end of the animation.</p><p>Scythes have extremely fast wind-up and down. So fast in fact that they&#39;re one of three zaw types where Air Lock isn&#39;t a noticeable issue for most runners.</p><p>Swords have fast wind-up and swing speed, but have slow wind-down and as such have noticeable air lock.</p><p>Machetes share the fast wind-up and slow wind-down of Swords but have a slightly faster swing.</p><p><u><strong>Slice</strong></u></p><p>Weapon type: Nikana</p><p>This archetype is specific to Nikanas. It has extremely fast wind-up and wind-down while having the longest swing time by a wide margin. This makes them feel extremely clunky to use.</p><p>Notes:</p><p>Contagion is thrown at the end of the swing.</p><p>Incredibly long swing time means Nikanas suffer from one of the worst air Lock durations of any melee. As you cannot animation cancel the swing by shooting, another method must be used.</p><p><u><strong>Stab</strong></u></p><p>Weapon Type: Rapier</p><p>This archetype is specific to rapiers and has a slow wind-up with a quick stab and a slow wind-down. The idle position is far from the start, and the wind-down animation is very inefficient.</p><p>Notes:</p><p>Contagion is launched at the end of the swing.</p><p>Animation cancel is extremely useful for this archetype.</p><h3 id="projectile-mechanics" tabindex="-1"><strong>Projectile Mechanics</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#projectile-mechanics" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Projectile Mechanics**&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>The projectile itself:</strong></p><p>There’s not much to say about the projectile itself beyond a few simple facts:</p><ul><li>The projectile velocity is not affected by your Zaw’s base attack speed, but it is affected by attack speed modifiers.

This DoT does Blast damage and Elemental Mods apply (meaning the DoT will do Blast, Gas, and Electric damage on a traditional elemental setup)</p><ul><li><strong>Radial Explosion:</strong></li></ul><p>The radial explosion can affect Profit-Taker if you hit a specific spot, however <strong>animation bug</strong> makes it impossible a majority of the time. The radial explosion does 5x the Zaw’s modded damage as Viral damage, and Elemental Mods apply.</p><p>What all these different damage instances mean for a runner is twofold;</p><ol><li>Exodia Contagion can clear up to 5 elements before Mods,</li><li>Most importantly, Exodia Contagion can clear up to 3 elements in one hit, meaning in the ideal situation over half of Profit-Taker’s shield can be cleared in one throw. The same damage instance can’t clear two elements, meaning if you get two IPS elements in a row you’ll need to throw twice, but it opens up some incredible possibilities. This is also why you always want to aim for the Viral spot if you can, even when you don’t need it to clear Viral.</li></ol><h2 id="pogris" tabindex="-1"><strong>Pogris</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#pogris" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Pogris**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Pogris is the name Speedrunners have given to using a Kuva Ogris with Nightwatch Napalm to take care of pylons. This can destroy pylons as they land, and damage pylons that have already landed, making this overall the fastest and most forgiving method of clearing pylons.</p><h3 id="why-pogris" tabindex="-1"><strong>Why Pogris?</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-pogris" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Why Pogris?**&quot;">​</a></h3><p>What Pogris brings to the table is briefly described and demonstrated <a href="/beginner/creating-builds.html#kuva-ogris">earlier</a> in Creating Builds when going over potential pylon weapons, but the gist is as follows:</p><p>Nightwatch napalm is an Ogris augment mod that leaves a damage-over-time effect where the rockets land which can damage pylons. By using this to our advantage, it is possible to destroy pylons as they land, massively speeding up solo pylons and dethroning a long-standing pillar of Profit-Taker speedrunning, the Zenith. To understand why, let&#39;s look at the advantages and disadvantages of using Pogris, and what can be done about the disadvantages.</p><div class="important custom-block github-alert"><p class="custom-block-title">Advantages:</p><p>In solos, Pogris is several seconds faster than the fastest solo Zenith time and allows one person using Pogris to do the work of an entire squad using Zenith. It is also significantly more comfortable and forgiving than Zenith.</p></div><div class="danger custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Disadvantages:</p><p>Kuva Ogris cannot deal enough damage to Profit-Taker’s shields with a Pogris build, however, this isn’t a major problem when using the On Call strats mentioned <a href="/advanced/speedrun-strats.html#on-call-strats"><strong>later</strong></a>, as they can cover all of Zenith’s elements without any time loss from having to swap weapons. Swapping weapons loses over half a second, and this is extremely bad in shield phases that ideally take under a second once damage starts being dealt. All in all, this is a disadvantage that is already mitigated.</p><p>However, there is another major drawback to Pogris: there is very little build variety for Kuva Ogris and Frame at the high end. This is elaborated upon more in Builds (see below), but TL;DR: without a good riven, Volt needs multiple red archon shards, maxed sling strength from the Madurai focus school, no QoL mods, and there’s only one viable Pogris build  (maybe 2 if you stretch it), with what amounts to three mods of options. This means that if you’re using the meta builds and you just can’t get fast enough to survive or you don’t want to spam energy &amp; shield pads, you’re SoL.</p></div><h3 id="builds" tabindex="-1"><strong>Builds</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#builds" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Builds**&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Rivenless Pogris build (Which element it is doesn&#39;t matter, however what bonus% it is, matters)</p><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/pogris.png" alt="pogris" style="width:100%;height:auto;"></div><p><a href="https://overframe.gg/build/602193/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em><strong>Overframe Link</strong></em></a></p><p>This build needs 427% strength with subsumed Eclipse, Vengeful Archwing and Arcane Rise/Vigorous Swap to 3-tick pylons consistently (will need 4 ticks otherwise).</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Note:</p><p>The Strength requirements can be offset somewhat by replacing Speed Trigger with Semi-Rifle Cannonade</p></div><p>This build consists of:</p><ul><li>Magazine so you have enough ammo to destroy all 6 pylons in the second phase</li><li>Multishot for 2 reliable rockets</li><li>Terminal Velocity because rockets are slow</li><li>Amalgam Serration because it’s a massive speed boost.</li><li>Fire rate because Ogris has low fire rate.</li><li>Fractalized Reset: procs off of a lot of things, most notably: Transference, Warframe abilities and Archwing abilities.
