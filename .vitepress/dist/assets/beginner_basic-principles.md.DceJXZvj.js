Knowing how your build works makes you more effective with it and allows you to tinker with it to suit your preference or to account for a lack of gear.</p><p>A good build follows these six principles:</p><h2 id="_1-dealing-with-knockdowns" tabindex="-1"><strong>1. Dealing with Knockdowns</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-dealing-with-knockdowns" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**1\\. Dealing with Knockdowns**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Knockdown immunity fully negates knockdowns and staggers, even those caused by your own weapons.</p><p>You might find builds that use knockdown recovery speed mods, but those are never worth it. Knockdown recovery only affects knockdowns, not staggers. Perhaps more importantly, you’ll still be interrupted very often, which disrupts the flow of the fight. This is why, even if you can only get a 90% chance to resist knockdowns, knockdown immunity should be used instead of knockdown recovery.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Nowadays, good builds deal with knockdowns in one of four ways:</p><ol><li>Knockdown immunity Mods - Primed Sure Footed or Sure Footed + Fortitude</li><li>Unairu’s Poise - active for 40 seconds.</li><li>Frames that have their own ways of providing knockdown immunity like Revenant.</li><li>Infuse Titania’s Spellbind.</li></ol></div><h2 id="_2-surviving" tabindex="-1"><strong>2. Surviving</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-surviving" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**2\\. Surviving**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Just in case you haven’t noticed yet, you deal more damage alive than when you’re dead. Builds have to both be tanky enough and be able to regain health.<br> Generally, tankiness is provided through a combination of using Adaptation, (Umbral) Vitality, (Umbral) Fiber, Arcane Guardian, Arcane Tanker, Shield Pads, the Ancient Healer Specter’s aura, and frame abilities.<br> Healing is primarily done by Magus Elevate, Magus Repair, Vazarin’s Protective Sling node, Elite On Call Crew with “heal 500 health on kill” or Vazarin’s Squad Regen node. Some builds may instead rely on frame abilities or weapon interactions to heal.</p><h2 id="_3-covering-all-elements" tabindex="-1"><strong>3. Covering All Elements</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-covering-all-elements" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**3\\. Covering All Elements**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>If you aren’t able to cover all elements, you have to cycle the ones you don’t have, waiting for the 5-second cycle cooldown each time. If you only bring 7 elements to the fight, you spend more time waiting for the cycle cooldown than it takes for some people to finish the entire fight.<br> Any good build will cover at least 12 elements across the primary/secondary/melee weapons and frame buffs. For builds where this is not an option, covering the missing elements with Voidrig’s Exalted Weapon Arquebex, using your operator to cover electric with your amp and virtuos surge, or using an on call crewmate is a good alternative.</p><p>To maximize damage, it is preferred for a weapon’s single stat element (Heat, Cold, Electricity, Toxin) to match the weapon’s Primed Elemental Mod, like Primed Cryo Rounds for primary weapons or Primed Heated Charge for secondary weapons. This is not possible with all builds (and Rivens), so not every build abides by these rules.</p><h2 id="_4-increasing-damage-for-all-elements" tabindex="-1"><strong>4. Increasing Damage for All Elements</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-increasing-damage-for-all-elements" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**4\\. Increasing Damage for All Elements**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>If we cover all elements but barely deal any damage with them, we won’t get very far. For that reason, all builds use frame buffs like Chroma’s Vex Armor or Mirage’s Eclipse, the latter of which can be infused onto any frame and is a better option even on frames that have their own damage buffs.</p><p>On weapons, we never spend more Mods than necessary to make a specific element. The remaining Mod space is used to buff all elements: it’s better to quickly take out all elements that a weapon covers than it is to instantly take out one element but slowly take out the others.</p><h2 id="_5-clearing-pylons" tabindex="-1"><strong>5. Clearing Pylons</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-clearing-pylons" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**5\\. Clearing Pylons**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Pylons have shield bubbles around them that normally prevent all shots fired outside of the bubble from entering the bubble and destroying the Pylon, forcing you to travel to each Pylon and destroy them once inside.</p><p>There are four (known) weapons that can pierce shield bubbles. Ogris, Kuva Ogris, Zenith, Fluctus. Fluctus is not practical and will not be considered.</p><p>Opticor and Opticor Vandal require you to enter Archwing to get a line of sight to the Pylons and shoot them without spending time on getting close.</p><p>The same applies to both Ogris variants, although Ogris allows you to preshoot Pylons, more on that later in <a href="/beginner/advanced-principles.html#pogris"><strong>Pogris</strong></a></p><p>Zenith, using its Alt-fire, additionally pierces terrain because it has infinite punch through. This means you can stay on the ground and fire at the Pylon waypoints through terrain and shield bubbles alike. Unfortunately, Zenith is not readily obtainable. You can only get it when you log in on days 100/300/500/700. Until then, you can use the Kuva Ogris or the Opticor Vandal.</p><h2 id="_6-clearing-the-armor-phase" tabindex="-1"><strong>6. Clearing the Armor Phase</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-clearing-the-armor-phase" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**6\\. Clearing the Armor Phase**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>During the Armor Phase, you can only damage Profit-Taker with Archguns. The game does not consider Arquebex to be an Archgun.<br> Players can choose to either have their frame wield the Archgun with the Archgun Deployer or have their Necramech wield it. Both options come with up-and downsides:</p><p>When wielding the Archgun on your frame, your buffs are applied to the Arch-gun, making it easy to deal a lot of damage. However, deploying the Arch-gun takes about 3 seconds, during which you can easily die to your surroundings or lose enough health to die or force you to heal again. Additionally, when you put away your Arch-gun, you can’t instantly get it back. Based on the gun’s max ammo and the ammo you use, you have to wait up to 5 minutes to use the Arch-gun again.<br> This means that the build has to optimize the damage per bullet and the Player has to minimize the ammo spent during each Armor Phase. Make sure you don’t waste ammo firing at already broken legs. This is why Ammo Chain may be part of some builds.<br> Alternatively, the Player can try to find and kill the Arch-gun-carrying corpus enemies. They will drop Arch-gun ammo restore that removes the cooldown from your Arch-gun.</p><p>When wielding the Arch-gun on your Necramech, your buffs aren’t applied to the Arch-gun, making it difficult to deal a lot of damage. However, Necramechs deploy instantly (as host) and only have to worry about magazine size, instead of max ammo.</p>',25)]))}const g=a(i,[["render",r]]);export{m as __pageData,g as default};
