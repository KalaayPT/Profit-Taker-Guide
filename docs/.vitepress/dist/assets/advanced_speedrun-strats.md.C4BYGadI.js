You can take advantage of this to get a better angle at the rear legs by leaving the elevator just a half second to a second after PT spawns (a bit after 8s on the ingame timer). This makes leg phase overall more consistent for fast runners, and minimizes the effect of the <strong>animation bug</strong>.</p><h2 id="on-call-strats" tabindex="-1"><strong>On Call Strats</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#on-call-strats" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**On Call Strats**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>On Call Crew is an extremely powerful tool for covering elements that essentially lets you have three weapons attacking shields at a time. This removes the need to switch weapons, and opens up the primary weapon slot for pure pylon damage.</p><p>On Call Crew requires you to run Total Eclipse, so they can profit from the damage buff as their damage without said buff is noticeably weak.</p><p>Ideally, Crewmate should be thrown straight at the ground while landing. This removes the need to wait for them to teleport, allowing them to start clearing shields immediately.</p><p>The ideal stat distribution for On Call is 00555 (5 Repair, 5 Combat, 5 Endurance). However this is extremely rare, so certain stats can be prioritized. The combat stat gives the Crewmate a base damage buff, making it top priority. Repair and endurance are for health regeneration and additional health, respectively. If you have problems with your crewmate dying prematurely during your runs, prioritize investing in the repair stat. Only elite Crewmates, unlocked at rank 10 Command Intrinsic, can reach this, as they start with 2 more base stats than normal Crewmates.</p><p>If you have an elite Crewmate, you ideally want one with the 150% primary critical chance (or 150% secondary if using Catabolyst) bonus, as it opens up a mod slot on the build. An elite Crewmate isn’t necessary, however.</p><p>The modern weapon of choice is <a href="/advanced/solo-speedrun-builds.html#crewmate-torid"><strong>Torid</strong></a>, as it leaves toxin clouds that consistently damage Profit Taker, meaning your crewmate doesn’t have to target Profit Taker the moment it’s toxin shield, they just have to have shot at Profit Taker recently.

This can destroy pylons as they land, and damage pylons that have already landed, making this overall the fastest and most forgiving method of clearing pylons.</p><h3 id="why-pogris" tabindex="-1"><strong>Why Pogris?</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-pogris" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Why Pogris?**&quot;">​</a></h3><p>What Pogris brings to the table was briefly described in an earlier section when going over potential pylon weapons, but the gist is as follows:</p><p>Nightwatch napalm is an Ogris augment mod that leaves a damage-over-time effect where the rockets land which can damage pylons. By using this to our advantage, it is possible to destroy pylons as they land, massively speeding up solo pylons and dethroning a long-standing pillar of Profit-Taker speedrunning, the Zenith. To understand why, let&#39;s look at the advantages and disadvantages of using Pogris, and what can be done about the disadvantages.</p><p>Advantage:</p><p>In solos, Pogris is several seconds faster than the fastest solo Zenith time and allows one person using Pogris to do the work of an entire squad using Zenith.</p><p>Disadvantages:</p><p>Kuva Ogris cannot deal enough damage to Profit-Taker’s shields with a Pogris build, however, this isn’t a major problem when using the On Call strats mentioned <a href="/advanced/speedrun-strats.html#on-call-strats"><strong>previously</strong></a>, as they can cover all of Zenith’s elements without any time loss from having to swap weapons. Swapping weapons loses over half a second, and this is extremely bad in shield phases that ideally take under a second once damage starts being dealt. All in all, this is a disadvantage that is already mitigated.</p><p>However, there is another major drawback to Pogris: there is very little build variety for Kuva Ogris and Volt. This is elaborated upon more in Builds (see below), but TL;DR: without a good riven, volt needs multiple red archon shards, maxed sling strength from the Madurai focus school, no QoL mods, and there’s only one viable Pogris build  (maybe 2 if you stretch it), with what amounts to three mods of options. This means that if you’re using the meta builds and you just can’t get fast enough to survive or you don’t want to spam energy &amp; shield pads, you’re SoL.</p><h3 id="builds" tabindex="-1"><strong>Builds</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#builds" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Builds**&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Rivenless Pogris build (Which element it is doesn&#39;t matter, however what bonus% it is, matters)</p><div style="width:100%;text-align:left;"><img src="'+i+'" alt="pogris" style="width:100%;height:auto;"></div><p><a href="https://overframe.gg/build/602193/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em><strong>Overframe Link</strong></em></a></p><p>This build needs 427% strength with subsumed Eclipse, Vengeful Archwing and Arcane Rise/Vigorous Swap to 3-tick pylons consistently (will need 4 ticks otherwise).</p><p>This build consists of:</p><ul><li>Magazine so you have enough ammo to destroy all 6 pylons in the second phase</li><li>Multishot for 2 reliable rockets</li><li>Terminal Velocity because rockets are slow</li><li>Amalgam Serration because it’s a massive speed boost.</li><li>Fire rate because Ogris has low fire rate.</li><li>Fractalized Reset: procs off of a lot of things, most notably: Transference, Warframe abilities and Archwing abilities.

However, damage instances dealing void damage will not change the shield element unless the 5s cooldown is over.</p><p>It is possible to take advantage of this by using a good amp with the Virtuos Surge arcane and Madurai’s void strike ability, letting you delete the rest of a shield phase once you see electricity, avoiding an otherwise unavoidable timeloss.</p><p>Ideally, this happens in the first or second shield element, as while the shield element will be changed unless the 5s cooldown is in effect, a good amp can easily remove all of Profit-Taker’s shield.</p><p>More info can be found in the Speedrun Builds <a href="/advanced/solo-speedrun-builds.html#operator"><strong>Operator</strong></a> section</p><h2 id="unscoped-zenith" tabindex="-1"><strong>Unscoped Zenith</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#unscoped-zenith" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Unscoped Zenith**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Quickly Shooting Pylons with Zenith is a challenging thing to do. If you aim for too long, the icons of other Pylons disappear, which means you need to unscope and look for the Pylons.</p><p>But, by using the unscoped Zenith strat, which is simply not aiming while shooting Pylons, you’ll have an advantage on how fast you can react to each Pylon, and you’ll be able to see more Pylons due to a wider field of view.</p><p>This is a high skill strat because without zooming in the margin of error is extremely small. Some people find this strat uncomfortable, and the weapon spread is wider, so your mileage may vary.  Using both Reflex Draw and Twitch is essential, as they almost eliminate all spread and recoil, greatly increasing the viability of this strategy.
