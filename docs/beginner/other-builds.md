## **Mech Setup**

Mech build doesn’t matter as you shouldn’t spend much time in it. A basic health Mod should be enough if you have problems.

#### **Corvas Build**

    <img src="/media/corvas_mech.png" alt="corvas_mech" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

[*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/601657/)

- For use on Necramech, this build can oneshot limbs if you charge it enough.
- Corvas is a good pick if you plan on getting rivens down the line, as it has a lot of viable riven variety.
- Fire rate is a bit low, so using Heavy Weapon may be faster.
- The build uses Primed Rubedo-Lined Barrel even if you’re using vex armor because Necramech doesn’t get Warframe buffs.
- Is affected by [__hitbox bug__](/miscellaneous/bugs.html#archgun-hitbox-bug)

#### **Velocitus Build**

</div>

[*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/367048/)

- For use on Necramech, this build will oneshot limbs if the weapon is fully charged.
- Velocitus shots are either fully charged or not charged, so you need to fully charge it.
- Velocitus only has a single pellet, so it will hit where you’re aiming, making it easier to avoid going underneath Profit Taker.

#### **Arquebex build (Used to clear Toxin Shield)**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="/media/Arquebex_mech.png" alt="Arquebex_mech" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

[*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/318743/)

- This is one of the best ways to clear Toxin for frames that can’t do it themselves. Manually cycling Toxin works, but this saves a fair few seconds.
- Any frame with an Exalted Weapon won’t need this. They can put Toxin on the Exalted Weapon.
- Volt and Saryn don’t need this due to Toxic Lash and Volt shield, respectively.
- If the last element in a shield is Toxin, you can go straight from clearing the shield with Arquebex to breaking legs with Corvas.
- Arquebex doesn’t do any damage to Profit-Taker’s legs or body.

## **On-Call Crew**

As the crewmate (more on this [__later__](/advanced/speedrun-strats.html#on-call-strats)) only needs to cover toxin (or electricity with Saryn), basically any weapon works as long as it:

- Has decent critical stats and good damage.
- Has a good enough fire rate.
- Ideally, has some sort of crowd control, i.e. chaining beams or explosions.

An example of a usable weapon is the Amprex, modded for toxin:

</div>

[*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/599307/)

- Crewmates don't use rivens or conditional arcanes.
- An elite crewmate with the proper cc effect can make point strike flex, as long as you get 100% cc.
- Other usable weapons are found in [__On Call Strats__](/advanced/speedrun-strats.html#on-call-strats)

## **Companion Builds**

#### **Smeeta Kavat**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="/media/smeeta_build.png" alt="smeeta_build" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

[*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/601642/)

- Essential mods are: Charm, Synth Fiber, Tek Enhance, Bite, Tenacious Bond, and Fetch. All others are flex. Make sure Charm is in the same mod slot as the build shown here due to companions using [__Precepts__](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Penjaga_Mods).
- This build should work on all Kavats, with Charm replaced as appropriate.

#### **Wyrm Prime**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="/media/wyrm_build.png" alt="wyrm_build" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

[*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/396909/)

- If not using Verglas, Warrior/Assault Mode is flex.
- Enhanced Vitality is flex.
- Wyrm Prime is the only sentinel with enough base shields to rely on Reinforced Bond.
- Negate allows you to drop other forms of knockdown resistance with a bit of skill.

__Weapons:__

#### **Vulklok Build**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="/media/vulklok_build.png" alt="vulklok_build" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

[*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/601634/)

- Full build is far from necessary. You can just use Point Strike to proc Tenacious Bond and be done.
- The Vulklok’s high base critical chance allows it to easily hit the 50% critical chance required for Tenacious Bond.
- For Tenacious Bond, only Critical Delay or Point Strike matter.

#### **Verglas Build**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="/media/verglas_build.png" alt="verglas_build" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

[*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/601638/)

- The Verglas can do a decent job clearing adds when helped by Total Eclipse, however its damage against shields is paltry.
