# **Advanced Principles**

*Essential parts of the fight that are well known, but that take a measure of familiarity and dedication to learn*

## **Timing The fight**

The Timer starts on the frame the minimap changes from the elevator to the Vallis, as seen in the following images:

In elevator:

<div style="width: 60%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="/media/inelevator.png" alt="Inelevator" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Out of elevator:

<div style="width: 60%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="/media/outofelevator.png" alt="outofelevator" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

And the timer ends when Profit-Taker flashes blue upon death as seen in the image:

<div style="width: 60%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="/media/timerends.png" alt="timerends" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Profit-Taker spawns at 8s on the in-game timer. Note that the in-game timer will reset once Warframe finishes loading the bounty, which takes \~4s on a good PC. This can take longer on slower systems. To get the most accurate time, stay in the elevator until this timer hits 8s after resetting. Only the host’s timer resets. This system helps avoid giving an unfair advantage to people with an extremely good PC.

As host, you can estimate your time by subtracting 8 seconds from the timer at the moment Profit-Taker dies, or you can track your time with the [__Profit-Taker Analyzer.__](https://basi.is-a.dev/pta/)

## **Landing**

For reasons given in the next section, your landing is one of the most important parts of the fight. A good landing sets up the rest of the run, and a bad landing will lose several seconds as the run progresses.

There are two general categories of landing: hard and soft. Soft landings are faster but harder to do and tend to become impractically precise as Archwing speed increases. Hard landings add some time loss but are quite simple.

For all landings, you want to be flying straight and level in Archwing, then leave early enough that you have time to cast your abilities and launch Zenith’s disc before you hit the ground.

See how when leaving Archwing I’m flying straight, not up or down? At the speeds of an Archwing, slight variations in trajectory can mean the difference between a controlled landing, massively overshooting, and quickly slamming into the ground.

### **Soft Landing**

A soft landing is when you hit the ground and can immediately start attacking Profit-Taker, any speed boosts generally make you too fast to come to a stop in time with the traditional soft landing.

To do a traditional non-Speed boosted soft landing, fly straight and level, exit Archwing such that you’ll hit the ground on an uphill, then hit slide when you hit the hill and use the slope to slow you down. You can then start throwing Contagion.

Abilities like Eclipse slow you down if you land while casting it, and should therefore be finished before you land.

Mountain:

For Mountain, blink up and towards the spawn such that you’re at the right height for landing, and blink once more on the way over. Exit Archwing around the rocks you pass over right before spawn, and slide up the side of the hill.

Lake:

For Lake, fly straight to where you want to land, there should be time for 3 blinks. The entire landing zone is uphill so this is the easiest landing to do.

Shrooms:

For shrooms, take a straight line through enrichment labs until you reach the crater rim, then turn into the landing so you have a good angle to land on the hill.

### **Hard Landing (Volt)**

A hard landing is when you land by doing a slam attack. This is almost necessary for Volt and squad runs due to the sheer number of speed boosts available. A full squad of Sprint Boosts is enough to make a soft landing difficult.

It is possible to cancel the slam attack by casting Volt speed, saving a few fractions of a second

Mountain:

First fly up while holding W, then do a blink after you line up with Profit-Taker. This saves about 0.2s when compared to blinking straight from elevator.

</div>

Lake:

Blink forward to the spawn, don't blink up or too far down or you'll hit the cliff.

Land near the left of Profit-Taker as it'll move to the left. This will help get a good angle to hit legs.

Shrooms:

Blink towards the spawn, don't go too high up, make sure you exit archwing early and leave enough time to cast Eclipse.

::: info Notes:
- During landing, you should not double jump or roll. Neither improves your velocity.

- It is better to leave Archwing too soon rather than too late. If you’re too late, you’ll always overshoot your target. If you’re too soon, you can compensate by aim gliding.

- If you’re using a Necramech for Armor phase, try to spawn it while landing, this will save several fractions of a second.

- Sometimes, the Necramech doesn’t spawn where you aim. This happens when you try to summon it too quickly after a big change in aim, like when you land. If you can find it, you can simply move to it and transference into your mech. Otherwise, you’ll have to deal with the 10s cooldown on the Necramech Summon.  
- As a client, one of the reasons the Necramech doesn’t spawn where you aim is because spawning mech is done by the host, not the client. You can avoid misplaced Necramechs by waiting a fraction of a second after sudden movements to give the host time to update your position and orientation.

- If you’re using your On Call Crewmate to cover all your elements, summon it while landing.

- In Archwing, you lose some speed when double tapping sprint to blink because you stop sprinting for a fraction of a second. For maximum speed when flying to Profit-Taker, set a separate roll keybind.
:::

## **Positioning**

Tying in with the previous section, Profit-Taker’s movement and attacks are largely based on your position. Some things directly, others indirectly. With proper positioning, Profit-Taker will sit and stare at you without attacking or moving. A proper landing is the first step of good positioning as the first shield phase is when Profit-Taker is most mobile and likely to turn.

<u>**Profit-Taker’s attacks and you**</u>

There are three attacks for which we know that they are based on the Player’s position:

### **The EMP Slam attack**

Profit-Taker slams the ground, sending out horizontal magnetic waves in all directions. You can prevent Profit-Taker from using this attack by <u>**not being too close to Profit-Taker**</u>. If she does use the attack, the magnetic waves can easily be avoided by being below or above them.

</div>

### **The Laser Sweep attack**
where Profit-Taker fires a massive laser that can deal thousands of damage in as little as three frames. Profit-Taker will only use the attack during or directly after the Shield Phase if you stand directly in front, to the sides, or behind her. If you notice the attack early, it is easy enough to dodge. Keep an eye out for when the legs ‘snap’ into position for the attack and dodge by not being directly in front of her. Don’t eat the lasers, they’re bad for your health.

Profit-Taker only does the Laser Sweep attack during certain phases. During others, she does 
### **The Mortar attack**
In this attack, she shoots a fiery ball in front of her that explodes a few seconds after it hits a surface. Move towards this attack to avoid the worst of the effect.

</video>
</div>

### **The Leg Zap**
which inflicts an extremely high damage Electric proc that both destroys your shield gating and can affect teammates with unavoidable damage over time. Profit-Taker will only use this attack when you are in front of one of her legs.

*As you can see in the gif, the laser attack doesn’t just come from the front*

    <img src="/media/legzap.png" alt="legzap" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

*Red is the laser attack, blue is the leg zap. Smile is the front*

Profit-Taker also has a couple of extremely annoying attacks that seem to be influenced by your position, but it's extremely precise.

### The **Bounce** 
appears to happen when you get too close to Profit-Taker during Armor and Pylon Phase. It shoots you away from Profit-Taker and is the only knockback to effect Mech. Rolling or bullet jumping into the bounce minimizes knockback. There is a guaranteed bounce while the first pylons are launching if you are close enough to profit taker. Being bounced during second legs can be avoided via the [__Push Strat__](/advanced/speedrun-strats.html#push-strat).

</div>

### **The Blue Walls** 
knock you back when you collide with them and can block Zenith shots. These appear to trigger more often when you’re beyond a certain distance from Profit-Taker and don't happen as much if the EMP slam or bounce attack happens.  
**How to deal with blue walls:** While Blue Walls are spawning, you will see light blue seams between walls. You can move and shoot through these seams. If you can’t reach a seam in time, roll into the wall as it hits you to avoid getting knocked back. Each wall can only hit you once, so once you roll into one you can walk through it like it isn’t there.

</video>
</div>

Try to stay just inside the distance blue walls spawn from, while staying outside of the bounce range.  A good range to aim for is about  25 m away from the main body. This will minimize both bounces and blue walls

__Profit-Taker movement and you:__

<u>**The most important thing to do is stay in front of Profit-Taker.**</u> If she targets someone more than 10-20 degrees off directly in front of her, she will turn to face them. This is generally a bad thing, as it can quickly ruin your ability to shoot some limbs (especially if you’re using mech) and you will be generally unable to reliably hit precise spots while Profit-Taker is moving. Volt is most sensitive to Profit-Taker moving due to his shields, which block a lot of the damage from Profit-Taker while being essential to many parts of the meta setup.

<div style="width: 60%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="/media/angle.png" alt="angle" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

TL;DR: For best results, stay in the green area when not playing Volt, since Volt’s shields protect him from the laser attack. The yellow area is where the laser attack happens, if you’re outside of the green area, Profit-Taker will turn to face you.

If you position yourself correctly, Profit-Taker will just sit and stare at you while doing minimal attacks.

:::info Note:
Profit-Taker has a Chin Turret that seems to target the Player/Specter closest to the orb, dealing massive damage. Can be blocked by Volt’s shield.

## **Exodia Contagion Zaws**

*Or: All you never needed to know about the ‘simplest’ part of the Profit-Taker kit*

An Exodia Contagion Zaw is the most important part of a normal Profit-Taker loadout as it is the only weapon that covers over a half dozen elements well. The Zaw is one of the easiest weapons to set and forget for Profit-Taker while having some of the most complicated mechanics. These mechanics are incredibly important if you want to understand why the recommended Zaw is the way it is. [__For custom zaw parts and builds see the weapon builds section.__](/beginner/creating-builds.html#zaw-part-setups)

For clarity, in this section **throw** means the button combination required for contagion, while the **launch** is when the contagion projectile appears from your zaw after you throw. This is important because contagion doesn’t launch at the same time as you throw.

### **Throwing Contagion**

There are a few ways to throw contagion, the traditional way to throw contagion for Profit-Taker is by double jumping, though there are a few ways to use bullet jump too. Bullet jump may be easier for people using a controller. A little note is that contagion doesn't care about what your current animation is, it only cares about the physical inputs.

When using double jump for contagion, many people bind jump to the scroll wheel to jump __extremely quickly__. The exact timing on how long to scroll for the double jump is FPS dependent, lower fps means you’ll have to scroll slower for the game to register the second jump. For most Zaw types, using scroll wheel is a bit excessive for merely throwing contagion, as Warframe limits the rate at which you can throw contagion to as fast as the contagion projectile can appear. Due to this, you may find yourself having to slow yourself down in order to throw reliably. The reason you’d want to use the scroll wheel over the spacebar is a technique where you ‘weave’ your gun in between contagion throws, reducing the cooldown from throwing contagion, and massively speeding up shield phases even if you have to swap weapons. The increased speed from the scroll wheel makes this weaving more practical.

It is possible to use bullet jump for contagion in Profit-Taker, but it easily ruins your positioning and is difficult to weave with. You need to move backward constantly to avoid getting out of position, and this leaves little time to shoot.

### **Melee Mechanics**

Besides the obvious stat differences between the various combinations of strikes and hilts, there are some important differences between the different *types* of melee weapons you can choose for your Zaw.  These differences can be mainly boiled down to two things; Air Lock, how long you get held midair while swinging melee; and Projectile Release, which is simply when in the animation contagion gets launched. To understand how they work you need to understand the different parts of an aerial melee attack.

An aerial melee attack has three parts: wind-up, swing, and wind-down.

During the wind-up, the melee is ‘readied’ as it moves from the idle animation to where it will start the swing.

Once it is in position, it will enter the swing. This is when you get the visual effect behind the blade. This animation cannot be canceled by shooting.

Once the swing has finished, the melee returns to the idle animation in the wind-down.

When you melee while aim gliding (like you need to for contagion) you get ‘locked’ at your current height during every frame of the melee animation, this is known as Air Lock. Wind-up, swing, and wind-down all scale with attack speed, however, certain melee types take noticeably longer to complete certain parts of the animation, and the scaling appears to be uneven.

<div style="width: 50%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="/media/meleetimingsidk.png" alt="meleetimingsidk" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

*This swing scales more with attack speed than wind-up or wind-down do.*

Melees with high wind-up, swing, or wind-down durations are the weapons that are most often referred to as having Air Lock, however, all zaws experience it. Air Lock is the deciding factor for many people when choosing what zaw type to use. The duration of the various parts of the animation cannot be directly linked to the aerial attack archetype, as certain parts of the animation can be dramatically different between two types in the same archetype (like swords and scythes). If you cancel the melee animation (most commonly done by firing your weapon, though emotes and some abilities do this as well, and usually faster than just firing your weapon) it will break the lock.

With no attack speed buffs or mods, Contagion is launched at either the start or the end of the swing. The point at which contagion launches for weapons that throw at the end of the swing does not scale with attack speed, however, the point at the beginning of the swing does. If you animation cancel the wind-up, all weapons throw after a certain delay. A new contagion projectile can only be launched after the previous one appears, so weapons that launch at the beginning of the swing can throw contagion at a higher rate, hence Balla (dagger) is considered to be the fastest zaw to throw with. However, these weapons also launch contagion from a different position.

Several weapon types share aerial attacks and idle animations, with variances in base swing speed, wind up, and wind down. The aerial attack archetypes are as follows:

<u>__Spin__</u>

Weapon type: Dagger

This archetype is specific to Daggers. It has a fast wind-up and swing while having a slow wind-down. When animation canceling by shooting Diplos or using emotes, this archetype is the fastest in terms of cooldown, allowing you to throw contagion more often than basically any other archetype. This is the current meta as of writing this portion.

Notes:

Contagion is launched at the start of the swing, when combined with their low wind-up time this makes dagger zaws the fastest in terms of damaging Profit-Taker near the start of shield phases. This is especially notable for the first shield, though it doesn't make a massive difference. Due to the extremely long wind-down duration, animation cancel is necessary for Daggers to compete with low Air Lock weapons.

<u>__Slap__</u>

Weapon types: Staff, Polearm.

This archetype is characterized by minimal wind-up and wind-down with a fast swing. The idle animation is the closest of any archetype to where the swing starts for these weapons and they return to idle incredibly quickly, making them the weapon of choice for many.

Notes:

Polearms have a slightly longer swing than staves.

Air lock is nearly unnoticeable, even with the slightly longer swing on polearms.

Contagion launches at the end or after the swing.

This archetype is recommended for all strikes that can get it.

<u>__Underhand__</u>

Weapon types: Heavy Blade, Hammer

This archetype is characterized by having high wind-up and extremely high wind-down time. The idle animation is very far from where the swing begins, and the swing ends extremely far from idle. This makes weapons of this archetype feel unwieldy to use.

Notes:

The extremely high wind-up and wind-down times make for a punishingly long air lock duration (among the highest) thus, animation cancel is extremely important when using a Heavy Blade or a Hammer in a run.

Contagion is thrown at the beginning of the swing. To take advantage of this, make sure to animation cancel during the swing animation.

<u>__Overhand__</u>

Weapon types: Machete, Sword, Scythe

This archetype is characterized by generally low wind-up, swing, and wind-down speed, along with a notable variation between the discrete types. The idle animation is moderately far from the start of the swing, with the swing ending fairly close to idle.

Notes:

Contagion is launched at the end of the animation.

Scythes have extremely fast wind-up and down. So fast in fact that they're one of three zaw types where Air Lock isn't a noticeable issue for most runners.

Swords have fast wind-up and swing speed, but have slow wind-down and as such have noticeable air lock.

Machetes share the fast wind-up and slow wind-down of Swords but have a slightly faster swing.

<u>__Slice__</u>

Weapon type: Nikana

This archetype is specific to Nikanas. It has extremely fast wind-up and wind-down while having the longest swing time by a wide margin. This makes them feel extremely clunky to use.

Notes:

Contagion is thrown at the end of the swing.

Incredibly long swing time means Nikanas suffer from one of the worst air Lock durations of any melee. As you cannot animation cancel the swing by shooting, another method must be used.

<u>__Stab__</u>

Weapon Type: Rapier

This archetype is specific to rapiers and has a slow wind-up with a quick stab and a slow wind-down. The idle position is far from the start, and the wind-down animation is very inefficient.

Notes:

Contagion is launched at the end of the swing.

Animation cancel is extremely useful for this archetype.

### **Projectile Mechanics**

__The projectile itself:__

There’s not much to say about the projectile itself beyond a few simple facts:

- The projectile velocity is not affected by your Zaw’s base attack speed, but it is affected by attack speed modifiers. This is why you want to Mod for as much attack speed as possible.
- The projectile uses the shape of the strike by default, but if you have a skin on your Zaw, Contagion will take the shape of the entire skin, while not changing the hitbox noticeably.
- The projectile’s hitbox is extremely weird, and anything people say otherwise is false, and there is probably something they’ve missed.

__Damage and Elements__

The Exodia Contagion projectile can cover up to 6 elements in 3 damage instances. The damage instances are as follows:

- __Direct Hit:__

The direct hit applies once and does an even spread of Impact, Puncture, and Slash(IPS). The base damage of this IPS is 2x the Zaw’s modded damage, and Elemental Mods scale accordingly off this. If a Riven Mod has an IPS element as its negative, it will mostly or completely remove whatever said element is.

- __Direct Hit Damage over Time(DoT):__

The direct hit also applies a DoT effect that pulses for 3 seconds for the Zaw’s modded damage. This DoT does Blast damage and Elemental Mods apply (meaning the DoT will do Blast, Gas, and Electric damage on a traditional elemental setup)

- __Radial Explosion:__

The radial explosion can affect Profit-Taker if you hit a specific spot, however __animation bug__ makes it impossible a majority of the time. The radial explosion does 5x the Zaw’s modded damage as Viral damage, and Elemental Mods apply.

What all these different damage instances mean for a runner is twofold;

1. Exodia Contagion can clear up to 5 elements before Mods,
2. Most importantly, Exodia Contagion can clear up to 3 elements in one hit, meaning in the ideal situation over half of Profit-Taker’s shield can be cleared in one throw. The same damage instance can’t clear two elements, meaning if you get two IPS elements in a row you’ll need to throw twice, but it opens up some incredible possibilities. This is also why you always want to aim for the Viral spot if you can, even when you don’t need it to clear Viral.

## **Misc. Trivia**

*Information that can be helpful when buildcrafting*

There is no ability or Mod that will buff or debuff Profit-Taker. You can only buff your weapons and frame.

__Pylon Phase__

The Pylons have exactly 15,000 **object class** health, this means no crit or faction multipliers apply when attacking them. Notable multipliers that **don’t** apply because of this:

- Faction Multipliers like Rhino’s Roar or Damage Bless

Madurai’s damage bonus works against Pylons.

__Armor Phase__

Profit-Taker’s limbs have 111,751 health;

Profit-Taker’s body health changes based on the phase;

- First body has 93,128 health
- Second body has 93,126 health
- Third body has 93,126 health
- Final body has 93,124 health

There have been multiple bugs and phase skips related to these damage limits not applying properly

__Shield Phase__

Each element will change upon one of three conditions, referred to in the following ways:

- If 25s have passed since the last element, the element is cycled;
- If at least 5s have passed since the last element change and someone attacks Profit-Taker with void damage, the element is cycled;
- If at least 156,720 damage is done to a single element, the element is cleared;

Each damage instance is capped at the damage cap stated previously, but multiple instances can do full damage until they reach (or exceed) the damage cap. See [__Untapped Potential__](/advanced/untapped-potential.html) for what this can be used for.

A common misconception is that the next element in the shield is completely random, this is not true.

At the start of the fight, all 13 elements are put on a list. This list is then randomized.

The elements appear in the order of this new list. When you’ve encountered all elements in the list, the cycle will begin again from the start of the list

Because the list isn't randomized twice, you can't have two of the same element in a row.

The shields can be cycled during the Shield Phases and during the second Pylon Phase, if an element you don't like comes up before the second Pylons land, you can cycle it.
