# Welcome to the Profit-Taker Beginner's Guide!

## What to Expect

In this beginner's guide, we'll cover everything you need to know to tackle the Profit-Taker fight with confidence. From understanding the mechanics of the fight to assembling the right gear, we've got you covered every step of the way. This Guide is also made to be data-friendly and the entire site does not use more than about 160MB of data.

:::warning ATTENTION:
The Jade Shadows Update changed the way archgun calculations and damage resistances work so some of the archgun info may not be up to date yet. Main takeaway is that Profit-Taker is now weak to magnetic.

We are using a workaround for the build screenshots, so capacity and multishot stats on archguns wont be displayed correctly
