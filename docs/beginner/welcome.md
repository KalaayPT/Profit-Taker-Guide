# Welcome to the Profit-Taker Beginner's Guide!

## What to Expect

In this beginner's guide, we'll cover everything you need to know to tackle the Profit-Taker fight with confidence. From understanding the mechanics of the fight to assembling the right gear, we've got you covered every step of the way. This Guide is also made to be data-friendly and the entire site does not use more than about 160MB of data.

:::danger ATTENTION:
The Jade Shadows Update changed the way archgun calculations and damage resistances work so our archgun builds are no longer up to date. We will update the builds as soon as possible (whenever Overframe adds Primed Dual Rounds so we can update the screenshots). 

Main takeaways are as follows: Everything has more health and Profit-Taker is now weak to magnetic

For now, just replace radiation with magnetic and fire rate with Primed Dual Rounds in your archgun builds.
