# **Squad Speedruns**

## **Roles**

*Squad strats aren’t fully optimized yet, there are still debatable choices. If you’re interested in finding new strats or wanna run with other people, we welcome you to join [__our discord server__](https://discord.profit-taker.com)*

A coordinated PT squad needs to focus on a few different things for a squad run to make good use of the additional manpower.

Generally, squads make use of at least one Archgunner, meaning one player who arrives at the orb and calls down a heavy weapon (or does an archlanding / uses Nova). The main reason for this is that an archgun in heavy weapon mode can receive warframe buffs like Eclipse, Roar or Wisp’s Haste Motes, allowing you to run a weapon with higher fire rate and lower damage to break legs faster. Since a dedicated archgunner can stay in archgun mode throughout the entire fight, it's possible to make full use of the advantages that heavy weapon archguns have over necramech archguns. Imperator Vandal (fell out of favor due to [__archgun hitbox bug__](/miscellaneous/bugs.html#archgun-hitbox-bug)) is usually the archgun of choice, since it has the highest fire rate.

## **Squad Volt**

- Volt provides essential speed buffs and damage amplification.
- He runs Eclipse and deploys shields to increase squad damage by a lot.
- Runs the same build as in solo, Total Eclipse can be removed for more str.

## **Squad Mirage**

- Mirage's clones significantly boost Archgun damage output.
- Duration is tweaked to make one cast of Eclipse last the entire fight.
- Shooting Gallery subsume for some extra damage without replacing Eclipse
- Can also be utilized for Pylons after Eclipse nerf, as Mirage retains the original Eclipse strength and can still oneshot Pylons. If 2 Mirages are used, one can subsume Roar.

## **Squad Pylons**
