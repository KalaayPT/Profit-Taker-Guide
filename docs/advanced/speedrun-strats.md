# **Speedrun Strats**

*Advanced techniques that require special thought to certain areas of the fight and involve more than your basic level of skill.*

## **Late Start strat**

Profit Taker walks forwards constantly until you destroy all four legs in the first armor phase. You can take advantage of this to get a better angle at the rear legs by leaving the elevator just a half second to a second after PT spawns (a bit after 8s on the ingame timer). This makes leg phase overall more consistent for fast runners, and minimizes the effect of the __animation bug__.

## **On Call Strats**

On Call Crew is an extremely powerful tool for covering elements that essentially lets you have three weapons attacking shields at a time. This removes the need to switch weapons, and opens up the primary weapon slot for pure pylon damage.

On Call Crew requires you to run Total Eclipse, so they can profit from the damage buff as their damage without said buff is noticeably weak.

Ideally, Crewmate should be thrown straight at the ground while landing. This removes the need to wait for them to teleport, allowing them to start clearing shields immediately.

The ideal stat distribution for On Call is 00555 (5 Repair, 5 Combat, 5 Endurance). However this is extremely rare, so certain stats can be prioritized. The combat stat gives the Crewmate a base damage buff, making it top priority. Repair and endurance are for health regeneration and additional health, respectively. If you have problems with your crewmate dying prematurely during your runs, prioritize investing in the repair stat. Only elite Crewmates, unlocked at rank 10 Command Intrinsic, can reach this, as they start with 2 more base stats than normal Crewmates.

If you have an elite Crewmate, you ideally want one with the 150% primary critical chance (or 150% secondary if using Catabolyst) bonus, as it opens up a mod slot on the build. An elite Crewmate isn’t necessary, however.

The modern weapon of choice is [__Torid__](/advanced/solo-speedrun-builds.html#crewmate-torid), as it leaves toxin clouds that consistently damage Profit Taker, meaning your crewmate doesn’t have to target Profit Taker the moment it’s toxin shield, they just have to have shot at Profit Taker recently. Other options are:

[__Kuva Chakkhurr__](https://overframe.gg/build/626709/), [__Amprex__](https://overframe.gg/build/599307/), [__Synoid Gammacor__](https://overframe.gg/build/626714/), [__Catabolyst__](https://overframe.gg/build/518597/).

## **Pogris** 

Pogris is the name Speedrunners have given to using a Kuva Ogris with Nightwatch Napalm to take care of pylons. This can destroy pylons as they land, and damage pylons that have already landed, making this overall the fastest and most forgiving method of clearing pylons.

### **Why Pogris?**

What Pogris brings to the table was briefly described in an earlier section when going over potential pylon weapons, but the gist is as follows:

Nightwatch napalm is an Ogris augment mod that leaves a damage-over-time effect where the rockets land which can damage pylons. By using this to our advantage, it is possible to destroy pylons as they land, massively speeding up solo pylons and dethroning a long-standing pillar of Profit-Taker speedrunning, the Zenith. To understand why, let's look at the advantages and disadvantages of using Pogris, and what can be done about the disadvantages.

Advantage:

In solos, Pogris is several seconds faster than the fastest solo Zenith time and allows one person using Pogris to do the work of an entire squad using Zenith.

Disadvantages:

Kuva Ogris cannot deal enough damage to Profit-Taker’s shields with a Pogris build, however, this isn’t a major problem when using the On Call strats mentioned [__previously__](/advanced/speedrun-strats.html#on-call-strats), as they can cover all of Zenith’s elements without any time loss from having to swap weapons. Swapping weapons loses over half a second, and this is extremely bad in shield phases that ideally take under a second once damage starts being dealt. All in all, this is a disadvantage that is already mitigated.

However, there is another major drawback to Pogris: there is very little build variety for Kuva Ogris and Volt. This is elaborated upon more in Builds (see below), but TL;DR: without a good riven, volt needs multiple red archon shards, maxed sling strength from the Madurai focus school, no QoL mods, and there’s only one viable Pogris build  (maybe 2 if you stretch it), with what amounts to three mods of options. This means that if you’re using the meta builds and you just can’t get fast enough to survive or you don’t want to spam energy & shield pads, you’re SoL.

### **Builds**

Rivenless Pogris build (Which element it is doesn't matter, however what bonus% it is, matters)

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">

</div>

[*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/602193/)

This build needs 427% strength with subsumed Eclipse, Vengeful Archwing and Arcane Rise/Vigorous Swap to 3-tick pylons consistently (will need 4 ticks otherwise).

This build consists of:

- Magazine so you have enough ammo to destroy all 6 pylons in the second phase
- Multishot for 2 reliable rockets
- Terminal Velocity because rockets are slow
- Amalgam Serration because it’s a massive speed boost.
- Fire rate because Ogris has low fire rate.
- Fractalized Reset: procs off of a lot of things, most notably: Transference, Warframe abilities and Archwing abilities. Will make reloads near instant as Volt and can be useful for double-shotting Pylons considering the limited Magazine on the Kuva Ogris

Here are your mod options for this build:

- If you use Void Strike to do the second pylon phase, you dont need to equip Tainted Mag, since Void Strike gives more than enough ammo efficiency to shoot all pylons
- Empty slot can be filled with a riven or Heavy Caliber. We highly recommend NOT using Heavy Caliber, because while it offsets the strength, the accuracy penalty is *extremely** noticeable.
- Speed Trigger can be replaced by Vile Acceleration, but you’ll need x% more strength to oneshot, or more damage rivens or frame. Vile Accel can also be put in the empty slot

Here are the ranges of required power strength with various setups:
<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="/media/pogris_recommendations.png" alt="pogris_recommendations" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Here’s what you can do on volt and elsewhere to boost your Pogris damage beyond power strength mods:

- Madurai Void Strike gives +1000% damage and is a good option for consistently oneshotting all pylons in the second pylon phase
- Arcane Rise gives a 150% damage mod, with reload on holster effects reliably triggering its 60% proc chance due to the gradual reload.
- Railjack intrinsic “Vengeful Archwing” (Gunnery 8) gives you an additional 25% damage while in archwing. Will not apply to projectiles that hit after leaving archwing
- Red archon shards can give you up to 50% power strength. 75% with Tauforged.
- Sling Strength from the Madurai focus school can give you up to 40% power strength.
- Vigorous Swap gives you a 165% damage mod, massively lowering power strength requirements/allowing you to run some better mods. This triggers when leaving archwing, so it synergizes well with the “Vengeful Archwing” intrinsic.
- Rifle Amp gives you a 27% bonus, offsetting mods like vile acceleration and decreasing power strength requirements.
- Molt Vigor gives you a 45% power strength bonus, however, you have to be careful to cast Eclipse afterward.

### **During the Fight**

When it comes time for pylon phases, recast your abilities as normal, then fly up. As always, attempt to minimize how much time you spend moving, the time you spend moving is time you spend not shooting pylon landing spots.

The higher you are, the easier it is to consistently see where all the pylons are going, so while it is important to not go so high that it takes forever to reach the ground, it’s better to be too high than too low.

Pylon landing locations are fairly predictable, and it’s just a matter of knowing where they can land. They only have a few set spots they can land, so there isn’t much guesswork to it.

Here are most of the common pylon spawn locations marked on shrooms and lake spawns:

[Pylon Locations (Imgur)](https://imgur.com/a/LJWFO5A)

Once you’ve shot all the pylon landing locations, return to where you took off from to avoid turning Profit-Taker. If you’ve done it right, you’ll have a small amount of time to prepare for the next phase. Make sure you swap to secondary before trying to do shield phases.

### **How to clear pylons fast - Double Shot + Void Strike**
by [__Vaeli__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2YnYYS5uGE)

Current meta for fast pylons is the following (assumes Riven usage):
- First pylon phase - double shoot pylons to 1 tick
- Second pylon phase - use Void Strike (madurai school) to 1 tick

Things to consider before running this strat:
- No matter the Damage roll on your riven, eclipse buff and progenitor percentage you can’t 1 tick with two shots unless you use either Vigorous Swap or Arcane Rise
- Second pylon phase requires you to run the Madurai focus school which means you’ll be more prone to getting knockdowns unless you run Prime Sure Footed or Sure Footed + Fortitude since running Unairu for Poise is not an option

##### First pylon phase

The “Reload while in archwing” route is a bit tricky since you effectively lose time because you are reloading meaning you’ll have to spot the right pylons faster, that said the gameplay looks like this: 
- Shoot twice
- Proc Vigorous Swap (skip if you’re running Arcane Rise)
- Repeat the two steps above
- Reload right after the swap (even though there’s normally a delay before shooting the reload starts instantly)
- Shoot twice
- Proc Vigorous Swap (skip if you’re running Arcane Rise)
- Repeat the two steps above

The alternative approach to this can be used if you have a dmg+ms+mag riven and can have 8 shots in your magazine. In this case the procedure looks like this:

- Shoot twice
- Proc Vigorous Swap (skip if you’re running Arcane Rise)
- Repeat 3 more times

This approach sacrifices the additional pylon damage (from a dmg ms 2+1- riven) or additional projectile speed (dmg ms pfs riven) for having to do less.

##### Second pylon phase

Void Strike

- Casting Void Strike can be done on the ground or in the air.
- Casting it on the ground will leave you prone to knockdowns that follow right after casting animation ends or enemies that might block your archwing when you return into your warframe.
- Casting in the air whether you void sling, bullet jump, or enter then leave archwing will make knockdown attacks less annoying since they won't reach you. (!! Beware if you void sling! Void Strike damage buff scales with energy usage so don't use too much)

Pylons

After casting Void Strike you go into archwing with roughly 6 seconds left on the buff, in this remaining time we must land all our shots. Void Strike also gives ammo efficiency which makes your magazine effectively bigger letting you to shoot more spots if unsure where the pylons are going to land


## **Push Strat**

When landing from first pylons, an issue a lot of people run into is that they get bounced while doing legs. As Profit-Taker’s attacks are dependent on Warframe distance, the way to avoid the bounce is to land out of bounce range (\~30 m away from PT) and use Transference to get into Mech.

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="/media/pushstrat_optimized.gif" alt="pushstrat" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

As you can see, I get walls instead of bounce as my Warframe is far enough away.

## **Using Necramechs**

*Placing and swapping to mech*

There are two ways to enter mech, proximity, and aim. You want to always use proximity as it is the fastest and most reliable. To do this, summon your mech in the proper place while or before placing shields.

Placing mech can and should be done during landing to avoid a time loss. See the following gifs:

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="/media/proximity.gif" alt="proximity" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="/media/placing.gif" alt="placing" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

See the speed difference?

You want to place mech to one side of the shields such that your camera will be behind the shields so you don’t have to worry about having to reorient yourself when it comes time for Armor Phase.

## **Field of View**

In theory, the higher your field of view the more Pylons you can see at once, and the more Pylons you can see the easier it is to get good Pylon time.

You can only get to 90 FOV in the game settings, but if you use Windowed mode you can use a wider resolution.

For the most extreme version of this, if you set your resolution to 32:9 (like in the picture below), you can get a maximized horizontal field of view. This makes it easier to get good Pylon time if you can still aim at them with the reduced vertical height.

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="/media/fovdemo.png" alt="fovdemo" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

The only way to do so is by dragging your window until it fits 32:9 resolution.

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="/media/fovslider.png" alt="fovslider" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

However, many people dislike this extreme for several reasons: It wastes a lot of your screen, It can be hard to see the Pylons on a small screen, and it doesn’t do much 21:9 doesn’t do.

21:9 is a more reasonable resolution.

Ultimately this is just a personal thing, mess around with various resolutions and see what works best for you.

## **Operator element**

**Note: this will invalidate a run for the purpose of posting on the speedrun.com leaderboards.**

Frames other than Volt or Saryn often find themselves missing an element, requiring a secondary, slower way of clearing said element outside of the normal weapon spam. However, damage instances dealing void damage will not change the shield element unless the 5s cooldown is over.

It is possible to take advantage of this by using a good amp with the Virtuos Surge arcane and Madurai’s void strike ability, letting you delete the rest of a shield phase once you see electricity, avoiding an otherwise unavoidable timeloss.

Ideally, this happens in the first or second shield element, as while the shield element will be changed unless the 5s cooldown is in effect, a good amp can easily remove all of Profit-Taker’s shield.

More info can be found in the Speedrun Builds [__Operator__](/advanced/solo-speedrun-builds.html#operator) section

## **Unscoped Zenith**

Quickly Shooting Pylons with Zenith is a challenging thing to do. If you aim for too long, the icons of other Pylons disappear, which means you need to unscope and look for the Pylons.

But, by using the unscoped Zenith strat, which is simply not aiming while shooting Pylons, you’ll have an advantage on how fast you can react to each Pylon, and you’ll be able to see more Pylons due to a wider field of view.

This is a high skill strat because without zooming in the margin of error is extremely small. Some people find this strat uncomfortable, and the weapon spread is wider, so your mileage may vary.  Using both Reflex Draw and Twitch is essential, as they almost eliminate all spread and recoil, greatly increasing the viability of this strategy. You can mod for more fire rate to make this strat more forgiving of missed shots.

Note: -recoil is needed if you want to shoot accurately with this strat.

## **Weapon Swaps (no On Call)**

**This strat is now defunct due to power creep. You can still go to the old versions of this guide that contain it [__here__](/miscellaneous/resources-used-honorable-mentions.html).** 

## **Ass Meta (with Cycron Crew)**

**This meta is now defunct due to __Animation Bug__ and new modding options. You can still go to the old versions of this guide that contain mention of it in the section [__here.__](/miscellaneous/resources-used-honorable-mentions.html)** 

## **Learning by Example**

By far the best way to get good at Profit-Taker outside of doing it yourself with the right builds is to go to the [__speedrun leaderboards__](https://www.speedrun.com/wf/level/Profit-Taker) and watch other people’s runs. There are things this guide cannot teach that you’d never imagine, but if you watch them do it, you just have to learn how to do it yourself.

Nearly all Profit-Taker runners mainly learned how to do PT quickly by watching runs and talking with people in the community
