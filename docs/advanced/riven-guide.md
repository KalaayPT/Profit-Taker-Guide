# **Riven Guide**

## **Slotting a Riven:**

For a Riven to be worth equipping on a weapon, it needs to replace at least one Mod of the rivenless build. 
**All Rivens should be entirely composed of given stats**

## **Kuva Ogris**

Damage + Multishot (ms over 50% is important to hit 3ms):

1. Projectile Flight Speed: most useful stat, drastically improves the time the projectile needs to get to the pylon.
2. Fire rate: self explanatory
3. Magazine capacity: Increases max mag size to 8

Rivens with only one or only both work too, but need [__workarounds__](/advanced/speedrun-strats.html#builds), Arcane Rise being the most common one.

**Negatives:**
Avoid Damage, Multishot, pfs, fire rate, and magazine; -Ammo max is usually harmless, it takes away a bit of reserve ammo though, so there is less tolerance for missed shots

## **Zenith**

Damage + Multishot:

- Element: Toxin is the most flexible element for all builds, but heat is good to use as well. This is the most popular as it greatly adds to build variety, and helps with Pylon consistency.
- Magazine: allows spam fire to offset bad aim.
- Fire Rate: makes spam fire faster.

Dual Stat of only Damage + Multishot is just as fine, more reliable Pylons while still oneshotting Shields.

**Negatives:**
Avoid Damage, Corpus, Multishot, Crit Damage, Crit Chance;

*Fire Rate and Magazine Capacity are bad, but won't entirely kill the Riven. Zoom is based on personal preference, but is generally disliked and considered worse for precision.*

## **Tenet Diplos/Tenet Detron**

Ideally, you have Toxin and Cold on your Riven, but if you have only one of them it's fine too. Riven needs an element due to disposition.

- Crit Damage
- Heat
- Damage
- Multishot
- Crit Chance
- Fire Rate
- Corpus

**Negatives:**
Avoid Damage, Crit Damage, Corpus, Fire Rate, Crit Chance, Multishot

## **Zaw with Attack Speed**

- Crit Damage: Yes.
- Damage: Yes.
- Element: Toxin/Heat/Electricity will be the most flexible.
- Crit Chance: Has to be at least 212.5% to reach 100% CC for consistency.
- Faction Contagion is OP and grades don't matter, except for CC. On a Volt with Eclipse and Shield, only an attack speed riven makes a difference, although very small and usually not noticeable, can run rivenless otherwise. But this doesn't mean you should be intentionally trying to decrease your damage by getting bad grades, mainly because of future disposition changes.

**Negatives:**
Avoid Physical Damage (IPS), Crit Chance, and Attack Speed;

## **Velocitus**

**Calculated with S grades & FR build, all Rivens can use non-FR build. Grades matter.**

<u>**CC Corpus rolls:**</u>

- Heat/Elec: Sabot or FR, will oneshot without Damage Blessing.
- Crit Damage: Magma/Charged or FR, would then need Damage Blessing or 3 Volt shields stacked.
- Damage: Magma/Charged or FR, would then need Damage Blessing or 2 Volt shields stacked.
- Multishot: to use FR you have to replace Hollowed Bullets and use bless or 4 Volt shields stacked.

<u>**CC MS rolls:**</u>

- Heat/Elec: replaces one of the elements to use FR, will oneshot without bless.
- Crit Damage: to use FR you have to replace Hollowed Bullets and use bless or 3 Volt shields stacked. 
- Damage: needs damage bless, won’t oneshot without even with 6 Volt shields stacked.

<u>**CC with 2 Damage stats:**</u>

- CD Heat/Elec: Sabot or FR, would then need Damage Blessing or 2 Volt shields stacked.
- DMG Heat/Elec: Magma/Charged or FR, would then need Damage Blessing or 4 Volt shields stacked.
- Heat Elec: Sabot or FR, would then need Damage Blessing or 5 Volt shields stacked.
- CD DMG: Magma/Charged or FR, would then need less, but won’t oneshot even with 6 shields.

<u>**CC MS Dual Stat roll:**</u>

Needs 133,4CC (B riven grade) on riven to hit 100% Critical Chance, needs bless to use FR, replaces Critical Focus with Containment Breach. Replace FR mod with 60/60 Heat/Elec mod when blessless. Won’t 1-shot with FR blessless even with 6 shields.

:::info Note: 
Multishot rivens are not preferred due to their tendency to only hit one of the pellets, doing half the damage.
:::

<u>**Negatives:**</u>
Avoid Multishot, Damage, Physical Damage (IPS), Crit Chance, Crit Damage, Corpus;

## **Corvas**

All of the above from Velocitus applies to Corvas. Corvas doesn’t need a really good grade or god-roll stats, but try to go for the best one you could get. Crit Chance is not necessary on Corvas.

## **Mausolon (Heavy Weapon)**

The main stat you want on a Mausolon is CC, for the best possible chance at critting. With it having the lowest disposition in the game you also want to have a 2+1 to have the maximum crit chance possible. The other stat being any useful damage stat.

A fire rate riven will be less consistent damage wise, but might be desirable for faster leg performance.

TL;DR: you want a 2 stat cc + elec/heat/dtc/cd/dmg/fr.
