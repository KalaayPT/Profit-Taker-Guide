# **Untapped Potential**

*What things haven’t been used to their full potential? These are NOT bugged things, it's things that are currently possible to do, but haven’t been used in a proper run for a time save. Ideally, this section becomes empty as these strats get used in world record runs or discredited.*

__Intentional 4/3 element shields:__

it is possible to do shields in 4 or 3 elements instead of 5, potentially saving several hundred milliseconds if it could be reliably done in a run.

**__Nova AG:__**

[__As noted in the squad section of the guide__](/advanced/squad-speedruns.html#squad-nova), Nova is an option to clear the first leg phase. This has not been used for a time save so far.

Example (click to play/pause):

<div style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
<video width="100%" onclick="this.paused?this.play():this.pause();arguments[0].preventDefault();" loop muted>
 <source type="video/mp4" src="/media/novaag.mp4">
</video>
</div>

**__Archlanding:__**

An alternative to the Nova strat is doing an archlanding to take out the archgun early, utilizing a rock along the way to Lake spawn to trigger the Archgun call.

Here is an example using Volt (click to play/pause):

<div style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
<video width="100%" onclick="this.paused?this.play():this.pause();arguments[0].preventDefault();" loop muted>
 <source type="video/mp4" src="/media/archlanding.mp4">
</video>
</div>
