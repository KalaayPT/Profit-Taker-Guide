# **Solo Speedrun Builds**

*These builds differ from basic builds in some notable ways due to stuff like the expected skill of the user and utilized tools. Builds that seek to buff certain things explicitly at the cost of other things normally seen as essential belong here.*

**Please do not mindlessly copy these builds. As a rule, they are extremely specialized. Read the descriptions, and ask any further questions in the discord.**

— Alternatives —

**Less Umbral formas:**

You will have less power strength, but you can replace any umbral mods with their regular versions. Chroma is rather tanky already, especially if you use elemental ward for defense purposes, so the lack of Umbral Vitality/Fiber shouldn’t hurt much. You can also consider replacing Fiber or Vitality with utility like Natural Talent.

**Padless:**

Arcane Nullifier is optional, but recommended if you plan on running without energy pads. With one Tauforged amber shard you should have enough energy to cast Eclipse 3 times, and have the energy for Effigy at the end.  
If you want to cast Elemental Ward, you can either use more yellow shards, or change Vigorous Swap to Preparation or Flow.

**No Primed Sure Footed:**

If you don’t have PSF, you can replace it with Handspring or add regular Sure Footed and replace Umbral Vitality/Fiber/Vigorous Swap with Fortitude.

### **Operator**

To make the best use of the Operator element coverage, Madurai is essential. Void Strike gives you a massive damage increase while also emptying your Operator energy, therefore guaranteeing Eternal Onslaught in the process. The best weapon to use is a Klamora - Certus (7x7) Amp because of its continuous high damage output.

## **Speedrunning Setup**

### **Volt**

</div>

Low duration Volt build. The higher range is so Total Eclipse more reliably buffs On Call Crew. Amar’s Hatred is a flex slot for this build and only used because of its polarity, because these polarities are compatible with both Eidolon and Arbitration builds. Relies on Ancient Healer Specter and/or shield pads to stay alive.

Natural Talent can be replaced with Augur Secrets and yellow archon shards or cast speed can be dropped altogether. Primed Sure footed can be replaced with Power Drift past a certain pace as knockdowns become increasingly rare and Wyrm can pick up the slack. Unairu is also an option if using power drift or if you don’t have PSF. Arcane Awakening is flex and can be replaced by either Molt Efficiency if you need more duration or Arcane Guardian if you have trouble staying alive.

## **Weapon Builds**

### **Kuva Ogris**

</div>

Kuva Ogris is entirely for pylons. Magazine size mods are so that you have enough shots for all pylons. Damage and multishot on riven lets you always twotick with decent power strength (rip Eclipse). Projectile speed gives the most QoL out of any third stat.

### **Zenith**

**This weapon is now defunct due to the speed and ease of use of Kuva Ogris. You can see it in old versions of the guide [__here__](/miscellaneous/resources-used-honorable-mentions.html).**

### **Tenet Diplos**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">

</div>

[*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/396859/)

Tenet Diplos doesn’t have much build variety. This build expects riven to have both toxin and cold, however, a riven with only one of the two will work, in which case replace Accelerated Isotope with the missing element. Diplos uses magnetic progenitor.

</div>

[*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/396863/)

High attack speed build, it saves a few milliseconds. Volt shield, Vigorous Swap, and Eclipse makes damage-increasing mods unnecessary, so the riven is only for increasing attack speed.

</div>

[*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/396891/)

This is a bless fr riven build without ms. If you have a riven that has ms, then depending on if your riven also has heat/electric you’ll replace either a heat/electric mod or Hollowed Bullets. If no damage blessing, replace Automatic Trigger with Hollowed Bullets (if you don’t have it on already) or a 60/60 heat/electric mod.

Explained in [__on call strats__](/advanced/speedrun-strats.html#on-call-strats), only works well with +150% primary cc crewmate. Make sure your crewmate isn’t behind your mech.
