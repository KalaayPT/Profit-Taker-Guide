# Welcome to the Profit-Taker Credit Farming and Speedrunning Guide!

## What to Expect

In this advanced guide, we'll delve into the intricate strategies and techniques required to conquer the Profit-Taker fight efficiently for credit farming and speedrunning. From mastering the fight mechanics to optimizing your gear setup, we're here to help you maximize your Cred earnings and shave off every possible second.

:::danger ATTENTION:
The Jade Shadows Update changed the way archgun calculations and damage resistances work so our archgun builds are no longer up to date. We will update the builds as soon as possible (whenever Overframe adds Primed Dual Rounds so we can update the screenshots). 

Main takeaways are as follows: Everything has more health and Profit-Taker is now weak to magnetic

For now, just replace radiation with magnetic and fire rate with Primed Dual Rounds in your archgun builds.
