## **Great guides of the past:**  
Profit-Taker guides have had a bit of a rocky history.  Many innovations have remained in relatively small communities for extended periods of time before becoming known to the greater public, and much Profit-Taker knowledge is communicated entirely via word-of-mouth. Here are some stand-out guides that have helped to spread Profit-Taker knowledge over the years. It is not a comprehensive list, merely the most notable.

[Fast & Easy Profit Taker - A Full In Depth Warframe PT Boss Guide [THE BEST CREDIT FARM]](https://youtu.be/oWvet2JCypU?si=UzEu4SZer1d-EBo4)

These two guides were at the time, and for a long time afterward, the most accurate and up-to-date Profit-Taker guides on youtube. As of the publishing of the first version of this guide, they were still the best.

**Blunt’s Profit-Taker guide:**

Written during the Saryn meta, this guide covers many important nuances of said meta. Blunt took the Saryn meta to its extreme through thousands of runs, reaching an impressive time of 1m 18s. Blunt referred to:

**Which was a follow-up to Iterniam’s *Six Principles of Profit-Taker:***

[**__The six principles of Profit-Taker - A speedrunner's guide. : r/Warframe__	**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/hft48g/the_six_principles_of_profittaker_a_speedrunners/)

Which have been integrated into this guide as the [__build basics__](/beginner/basic-principles.html) section. This was the first good Profit-Taker guide, but it really shows its age.
