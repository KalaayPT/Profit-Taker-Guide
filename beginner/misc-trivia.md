# Misc. Trivia

*Information that can be helpful when buildcrafting*

There is no ability or Mod that will buff or debuff Profit-Taker. You can only buff your weapons and frame.

### __Pylon Phase__

The Pylons have exactly 15,000 **object class** health, this means no crit or faction multipliers apply when attacking them. Notable multipliers that **don’t** apply because of this:

- Faction Multipliers like Rhino’s Roar or Damage Bless

Madurai’s damage bonus works against Pylons.

### __Armor Phase__

Profit-Taker’s limbs have 180,961 health;

Profit-Taker’s body health changes based on the phase;

- First body has 150,803 health
- Second body has 150,801 health
- Third body has 150,801 health
- Final body has 150,799 health

There have been multiple bugs and phase skips related to these damage limits not applying properly

### __Shield Phase__

Each element will change upon one of three conditions, referred to in the following ways:

- If 25s have passed since the last element, the element is cycled;
- If at least 5s have passed since the last element change and someone attacks Profit-Taker with void damage, the element is cycled;
- If at least 162,993 damage is done to a single element, the element is cleared;

Each damage instance is capped at the damage cap stated previously, but multiple instances can do full damage until they reach (or exceed) the damage cap. See [__Untapped Potential__](/advanced/untapped-potential.html) for what this can be used for.

A common misconception is that the next element in the shield is completely random, this is not true.

At the start of the fight, all 13 elements are put on a list. This list is then randomized.

The elements appear in the order of this new list. When you’ve encountered all elements in the list, the cycle will begin again from the start of the list

Because the list isn't randomized twice, you can't have two of the same element in a row.

The shields can be cycled during the Shield Phases and during the second Pylon Phase, if an element you don't like comes up before the second Pylons land, you can cycle it.
