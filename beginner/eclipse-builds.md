# Eclipse Builds

## **Warframe Builds - Eclipse**

This section covers generic builds for frames using Eclipse  
This includes: Volt builds, Saryn builds, Chroma builds, etc  
They are generally tailored to specific primary weapon setups  
Suggested Warframe Arcanes include : Tanker, Guardian, Avenger, Acceleration, Velocity, Vigor   
Suggested operator Arcanes include: Elevate, Repair, Lockdown, Cloud  

This is a generic Profit-Taker build for every frame if Eclipse is subsumed.

#### Generic Frame Builds

::::tabs
== Zenith/Opticor Frame Build

</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/601655/)

- Since Dante Unbound, oneshotting Pylons rivenless with Zenith and subsumed Eclipse is no longer possible. This build relies on either Sling Strength or more added strength (about 40%) to 2-shot with Zenith.
- Opticor always oneshots fully charged; depending on the setup, quick shots will need about 50% charge to oneshot with this build
- If you have Primed Sure Footed, remove Fortitude and Sure Footed. Put Primed Sure Footed in the Exilus slot.
- Any empty slots are flex slots.
- Streamline is flex.
- Augur Secrets is there so the build goes to about 280% power strength. Make sure you maintain high power strength or Zenith will start having performance issues. Transient fortitude is a reasonable replacement.
- If you can survive, consider running Zenurik to reduce energy pad use or replacing Umbral Vitality with a QoL or power strength mod.
- Consider using Sprint Boost in the aura slot to reach Profit-Taker faster.

== Pogris Frame Build

This build is nearly the bare minimum for a Kuva Ogris setup, assumes you use a crewmate to cover toxin

</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/663626/)

- This build relies on the Vengeful Archwing Intrinsic and 5 str shards to 3-tick pylons, will need 4 otherwise
- If you don't have Primed Sure Footed, you can use Sure Footed+Fortitude, will cost you pylon time
- With this build, a rivenless Kuva Ogris will destroy pylons in 3-4 damage ticks
- Vigorous Swap will always boost pylon damage when you leave archwing.

#### **Saryn**

Saryn notably has Toxic Lash and Venom Dose, which provide additional Corrosive and Toxin on all weapons.

There are three useful Aura Mods: Sprint Boost, Growing Power, and Aerodynamic. Aerodynamic is mostly just to fit the default polarity.

== TriUmbral Saryn

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/328823/)
- Mods on the first build can be replaced by Mods on the second build. The second build relies on Unairu Poise for knockdown resistance.
- TriUmbral is unnecessary, you can replace Umbral Fiber with Transient Fortitude.
- The general Eclipse build is an option for Saryn too.
- Consider running Zenurik for Energy.
- Can also run a Pogris build, would need to replace Narrow Minded and add Total Eclipse

## **Weapon Builds - Eclipse**

Missing elements can be covered via: Warframe abilities, primary weapon, on call crewmate, manually cycling, Amp Arcanes, or Arquebex

__Primary weapons:__

#### **Zenith**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/Zenith_Build.png" alt="zenith_eclipse" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/650129/)

Covers toxin. Twitch is flex. This is the bare minimum build required to oneshot Pylons with the Generic Eclipse build and Sling Strength / Transient Fortitude. It relies on Multishot to oneshot, so to increase its consistency you can:

- You can use a maxed Vigilante Armaments and Galvanized Chamber to have 3ms
- Invest in a dmg ms riven of any kind, this will allow you to oneshot 
- If you don't need Zenith to do shields, replace the crit mods with more fire rate
:::

#### **Opticor Vandal**

:::danger ATTENTION:
DOES NOT WORK AS OF WRITING THIS
:::

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/opticor_eclipse.png" alt="opticor_eclipse" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/663619/)

- Needs about 60% charge to oneshot with the provided frame build
- Covers toxin.
- Twitch and fire rate are flex
- Opticor Vandal has no problems oneshotting Pylons, though you need to use Archwing to go around mountains.
- Point Strike over Critical Delay due to the noticeable charge time. -fire rate is very bad for the Opticor Vandal.
- if you don't need Opticor to do shields, replace the crit mods with more fire rate
:::

#### **Kuva Ogris (Pogris)**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/pogris_eclipse.png" alt="pogris_eclipse" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/663638/)

- Since Dante Unbound, Pogris is extremely despairge but still more comfortable than zenith or opticor; needs 427% to only take 3 instead of 4 damage ticks to destroy Pylons with the provided frame build, Sling str and 5 str shards. An alternative to this approach would be to [__double shot pylons__](/advanced/speedrun-strats.html#fast-pogris-pylons-double-shot-void-strike) to require two ticks instead
- Nightwatch Napalm will damage Pylons as long as they are in range, even through the Pylon bubble.
- Damage is extremely sensitive to warframe power strength, very few things will increase Nightwatch Napalm damage.
- Normal Ogris also works well enough if Kuva Ogris feels too grindy. Does less damage (adding Heavy Caliber in place of Vile Acceleration is an option, but makes you miss the pylon sometimes) but only needs one ammo mod. The other one can be replaced with Firestorm on a standard Ogris, for slightly less required accuracy especially if combined with Heavy Caliber.

__Secondary weapon:__

#### **Tenet Diplos build**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/diplos_eclipse.png" alt="diplos_eclipse" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/601639/)

- Covers heat, magnetic (progenitor) and viral
- If you don't have Diplos, you can use the Tenet Detron, Tenet Cycron, Synoid Gammacor or any weapon with innate (or progenitor) magnetic, really.
- Reflex Draw is flex
- Cascadia Overcharge assumes shield pad usage. If you don't use shield pads, you can use Deadhead for less recoil or Merciless if you are able to build stacks.
:::

__Melee weapon:__

#### **Contagion Build**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/balla_eclipse.png" alt="balla_eclipse" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/601643/)

- Covers IPS, cold, radiation, gas, corrosive and blast.
- Rank 0 Melee Exposure is just fine on most builds.
- Rank >0 Exodia Contagion is not necessary.
- If you don't oneshot elements, consider replacing attack speed mods with Primed Pressure Point and/or Organ shatter or modding for more strength.
- The Zaw is Balla+Peye+Vargeet II Jai. If you have a different strike, see [__How to Build A Zaw__](/beginner/creating-builds.html#zaw-part-setups) for making a Zaw with a different strike.
:::

__Heavy weapon:__

#### **Mausolon Build**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/Mausolon_eclipse.png" alt="Mausolon_eclipse" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/706001/)

- People commonly don’t have Primed Dual Rounds or Critical Focus, if so, replace them with Normal Dual Rounds, Sabot Rounds or the Cold/Electric 60/60 Mods for best results.
- Running Ammo Chain instead of Automatic Trigger to avoid cooldowns, especially between second and third legs, is a possibility.
- Running Vigorous Swap greatly impacts the amount of damage you deal with Heavy Weapons, as it applies **after** the animation has finished, and is therefore usable for doing the leg phase
:::

**Prisma Dual Decurions:**   
Runs the same build as Mausolon but has a faster fire rate. Prisma Dual Decurions are quite unforgiving when it comes to wasting ammo, consider running Mausolon instead.
