# Eclipse Builds

## **Warframe Builds - Eclipse**

This section covers generic builds for frames using Eclipse  
This includes: Volt builds, Mirage builds, Saryn builds, etc  
They are generally tailored to specific primary weapon setups  
Suggested Warframe Arcanes include : Guardian, Avenger, Acceleration, Velocity   
Suggested operator Arcanes include: Elevate, Repair, Lockdown, Cloud  

This is a generic Profit-Taker build for every frame if Eclipse is subsumed.

#### Generic Frame Builds

::::tabs
== Ogris Frame Build

This build is nearly the bare minimum for a Kuva Ogris setup, assumes you use a crewmate to cover toxin

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/771300/)

- This build relies on the Vengeful Archwing Intrinsic and 5 str shards to 3-tick pylons, will need 4 otherwise
- If you don't have Primed Sure Footed, you can use Sure Footed+Fortitude, can cost you pylon time
- With this build, a rivenless Kuva Ogris will destroy pylons in 3-4 damage ticks
- Vigorous Swap will always boost pylon damage when you leave archwing.
- destroying the pylons in one tick is only possible with a riven.

== Zenith Frame Build

</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/771301)

- Since Dante Unbound, oneshotting Pylons rivenless with Zenith and subsumed Eclipse is no longer possible. This build relies on either Sling Strength or more added strength (about 40%) to 2-shot with Zenith.
- If you have Primed Sure Footed, remove Fortitude and Sure Footed. Put Primed Sure Footed in the Exilus slot.
- Any empty slots are flex slots.
- Streamline is flex.
- Augur Secrets is there so the build goes to about 280% power strength. Make sure you maintain high power strength or Zenith will start having performance issues. Transient fortitude is a reasonable replacement.
- If you can survive, consider running Zenurik to reduce energy pad use or replacing Umbral Vitality with a QoL or power strength mod.
- Consider using Sprint Boost in the aura slot to reach Profit-Taker faster.

#### **Saryn**

Saryn notably has Toxic Lash and Venom Dose, which provide additional Corrosive and Toxin on all weapons.

There are three useful Aura Mods: Sprint Boost, Growing Power, and Aerodynamic. Aerodynamic is mostly just to fit the default polarity.

::::tabs
== TriUmbral Saryn

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/771302/)
- Mods on the first build can be replaced by Mods on the second build. The second build relies on Unairu Poise for knockdown resistance.
- TriUmbral is unnecessary, you can replace Umbral Fiber with Transient Fortitude.
- The general Eclipse build is an option for Saryn too.
- Consider running Zenurik for Energy.
- Can also run a Pogris build, would need to replace Narrow Minded and add Total Eclipse

## **Weapon Builds - Eclipse**

Missing elements can be covered via: Warframe abilities, primary weapon, on call crewmate, manually cycling, Amp Arcanes, or Arquebex

__Primary weapons:__

#### **Kuva Ogris (Pogris)**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/u/pogris_eclipse.png" alt="pogris_eclipse" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/771293/)

- since Dante Unbound, Pogris needs 427% to only take 3 instead of 4 damage ticks to destroy Pylons with the provided frame build, Sling str and 5 str shards. An alternative to this approach would be to [__double shot pylons__](/advanced/speedrun-strats.html#fast-pogris-pylons-double-shot-void-strike) to require two ticks instead
- Nightwatch Napalm will damage Pylons as long as they are in range, even through the Pylon bubble.
- Damage is extremely sensitive to warframe power strength, very few things will increase Nightwatch Napalm damage.
- Normal Ogris also works well enough if Kuva Ogris feels too grindy. Does less damage but only needs one ammo mod. Damage can be offset a bit with Heavy Caliber, but that makes it less accurate. The other ammo mod can be replaced with Firestorm on a standard Ogris, for slightly less required accuracy especially if combined with Heavy Caliber.

#### **Zenith**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/u/Zenith_Build.png" alt="zenith_eclipse" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/771294/)

Covers toxin. Twitch is flex. This is the bare minimum build required to oneshot Pylons with the Generic Eclipse build and Sling Strength / Transient Fortitude. It relies on Multishot to oneshot, so to increase its consistency you can:

- You can use a maxed Vigilante Armaments and Galvanized Chamber to have 3ms
- Invest in a dmg ms riven of any kind, this will allow you to oneshot 
- if you don't need Zenith to do shields, replace the crit mods with more fire rate
:::

__Secondary weapon:__

#### **Tenet Diplos build**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/u/diplos_eclipse.png" alt="diplos_eclipse" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/771304/)

- Covers heat, magnetic (progenitor) and viral
- If you don't have Diplos, you can use the Tenet Detron, Tenet Cycron, Synoid Gammacor or any weapon with innate (or progenitor) magnetic, really.
- Reflex Draw is flex
- Cascadia Overcharge assumes shield pad usage. If you don't use shield pads, you can use Deadhead for less recoil or Merciless if you are able to build stacks.
:::

__Melee weapon:__

#### **Contagion Build**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/u/balla_eclipse.png" alt="balla_eclipse" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/771297/)

- Covers IPS, cold, radiation, gas, corrosive and blast.
- Rank 0 Melee Exposure is just fine on most builds.
- Rank >0 Exodia Contagion is not necessary.
- If you don't oneshot elements, consider replacing attack speed mods with Primed Pressure Point and/or Organ shatter or modding for more strength.
- The Zaw is Balla+Peye+Vargeet II Jai. If you have a different strike, see [__How to Build A Zaw__](/beginner/creating-builds.html#zaw-part-setups) for making a Zaw with a different strike.
:::

__Heavy weapon:__

#### **Mausolon Build**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/u/Mausolon_eclipse.png" alt="Mausolon_eclipse" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/771305/)

- People commonly don’t have Primed Dual Rounds or Critical Focus, if so, replace them with Normal Dual Rounds, Sabot Rounds or the Cold/Electric 60/60 Mods for best results.
- Running Ammo Chain instead of Automatic Trigger to avoid cooldowns, especially between second and third legs, is a possibility.
- Running Vigorous Swap greatly impacts the amount of damage you deal with Heavy Weapons, as it applies **after** the animation has finished, and is therefore usable for doing the leg phase
:::

**Prisma Dual Decurions:**   
Runs the same build as Mausolon but has a faster fire rate. Prisma Dual Decurions are quite unforgiving when it comes to wasting ammo, consider running Mausolon instead.
