# Basic Builds

*Simple builds that aren’t highly specialized for stuff like Crewmate and Total Eclipse. Builds here are more generalized and less highly specific, at least for frames. You can go to the next section for build crafting. This section allows you to hit the ground running without having to learn EVERYTHING about building.*

We've tried our best to make cheap builds that do extremely well. When copying these builds, replace any Primed Mods you don't have with a Mod of the same effect, and to save Endo and Forma consider running rank 8 Mods instead of rank 10. Feel free to mess around with 'flex' Mods, but **any Mod not listed as 'flex' can be considered mandatory** for these builds to work properly.

## **Chroma builds - Vex Armor**

These builds are for Chroma running Vex Armor. QoL is a priority in this section.  
Suggested Warframe Arcanes include: Tanker, Guardian, Avenger, Acceleration, Velocity, Vigor

#### **Generic Vex Armor**

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/318737)

- This is the generic build for this section, the others are example variations.
- If you don’t have Primed Sure Footed, use Unairu Poise, subsume Spellbind, or run Sure Footed+Fortitude in the empty slots. You may need to invest some Forma to do this. The remaining empty slots are flexible.
- Augur Secrets helps this build reach a high power strength, consider replacing it with more power strength if you decide to invest more Forma in this build.
- Streamline is a flex Mod. It means you can keep your Effigy down longer at the end of the fight, making it easier to time for the double credits.
- Consider adding Rage/Hunter Adrenaline for energy. Maybe in place of PSF if you have an alternate form of status immunity.
- Consider running Zenurik for Energy.
- Heat elemental ward gives you the most EHP, along with healing you when you recast. This means you may be able to forego alternate forms of healing in a pinch.
- If heat/cold Elemental Ward isn’t needed for survivability, use toxin for more dps.
- A single Umbal Forma is the most efficient (in terms of build variety) for any Profit-Taker frame as Umbral Intensify is used in the *vast* majority of Profit-Taker builds. However, it is not strictly necessary for this build.
- Steel Charge isn’t special aside from the extra capacity, any aura works.
- You can replace Primed Mods with non-Primed Mods, and consider running rank 8 Mods instead of rank 10.
- Using Rage, Energy Nexus, Flow, Preparation and/or amber archon shards can allow you to run without energy pads.
- Consider running a Decaying Dragon Key or slotting rank 0 Catalyzing Shields to reduce your shieldgate to 0.33s.

#### **Parasitic Armor**

</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/626814/)

- Sort of a halfway point between Eclipse and normal Vex build, giving a mix of fast shield clears and being tanky. The biggest weakness of Vex armor is the slow start of building your stacks, and removing your shields speeds it up significantly.
- Using archwing while on the ground makes you take damage and can be used to proc Vex’ damage bonus when at 0 shields. Also procs Avenger. May be inconsistent as client.
- This build assumes you’re running with an On Call Crewmate. If you don’t have one though, you can use Narrow Minded instead of Primed Continuity.
- Consider running a Decaying Dragon Key or slotting rank 0 Catalyzing Shields to reduce your shieldgate to 0.33s.
- Activating parasitic armor also activates your shield gate even though your healthbar stays red.

#### **Dispensary**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">

</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/318702/)

- Example helminth subsume build, using dispensary for the energy generation.
- A majority of the generic build’s tips apply here.
- Primed Continuity can be replaced by Narrow Minded.
- Equilibrium is a flex Mod. It makes Dispensary more effective. 
:::

#### **Nourish**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">

</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/451919/)

- Alternative to using Dispensary- Nourish Grants Viral to all weapons.
- A majority of the generic build’s tips apply here.
- You can replace Primed Mods with non-Primed Mods, and consider running rank 8 Mods instead of rank 10.
- Augur Secrets isn't necessary; you can swap it for Augur Message  for more duration or drop Secrets and Power Drift for Constitution(+ rank 2 Augur Message) if needing more duration.
- In the same vein, you can drop Augur Secrets/Power Drift and Swap Primed Continuity for Narrow Minded.

## Weapon Builds - Vex Armor

*The following builds don’t run Damage Mods (other than Amalgam Serration) because Vex Armor is additive with Damage Mods.*

__Primary weapon:__

#### **Kuva Ogris**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/pogris_eclipse.png" alt="pogris_eclipse" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/663638/)

- Needs 277%+ Strength to kill a pylon in two damage ticks, cannot go lower than that as very few things can increase Nightwatch Napalm damage, especially as Chroma.
- Nightwatch Napalm will damage Pylons as long as they are in range, even through the Pylon bubble.
- Normal Ogris also works well enough if Kuva Ogris feels too grindy. Does less damage (adding Heavy Caliber in place of Vile Acceleration is an option, but makes you miss the pylon sometimes) but only needs one ammo mod. The other one can be replaced with Firestorm on a standard Ogris, for slightly less required accuracy especially if combined with Heavy Caliber.

#### **Zenith Build**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/Zenith_Build.png" alt="Zenith_Build" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/650129/)

- Covers toxin 
- Despite Vex Armor giving an additive damage bonus, Amalgam Serration is used for its sprint speed buff. 
- This build relies on multishot to destroy Pylons. 
- Vex Armor needs to be ramped up to oneshot pylons. This is extremely sensitive to any changes in power strength and needs about 278%str or higher to oneshot (achievable with Blind Rage + Umbral Intensify+Vitality + Augur Secrets)
- if you don't need Zenith to do shields, replace the crit mods with more fire rate
:::


#### **Opticor Vandal Build**

:::danger ATTENTION:
DOES NOT WORK AS OF WRITING THIS
:::

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/Opticor_Vandal_Build.png" alt="Opticor_Vandal_Build" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/661307/)

- Covers toxin
- Despite Vex Armor giving an additive damage bonus, Amalgam Serration is used for its sprint speed buff. 
- Opticor Vandal has more than enough damage to one-hit Pylons with Vex Armor. 
- Vex Armor needs to be ramped up to oneshot pylons. Needs 322%str or higher to oneshot at the lowest possible charge (around 30%)
- Point Strike over Critical Delay due to the noticeable charge time. -fire rate is very bad for the Opticor Vandal.
- if you don't need Opticor to do shields, replace the crit mods with more fire rate
:::

__Secondary weapon:__

#### **Tenet Diplos Build**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/Vex_Armor_Tenet_Diplos_Build.png" alt="Vex_Armor_Tenet_Diplos_Build" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/661076/)

- Covers heat, magnetic (progenitor) and viral
- Lethal Torrent can be replaced with Accelerated Isotope so you don't have to rely on Contagion for Radiation
- If you don't have Diplos, you can use the Tenet Detron, Tenet Cycron, Synoid Gammacor or any weapon with innate (or progenitor) magnetic, really.
- Reflex Draw is flex
- Cascadia Overcharge assumes shield pad usage. If you don't use shield pads, you can use Deadhead for less recoil or Merciless if you are able to build stacks.
:::

__Melee weapon:__

#### **Exodia Contagion Zaw Build**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/balla_eclipse.png" alt="Exodia_Contagion_Zaw_Build" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/601643/)

- Covers IPS, cold, radiation, gas, corrosive and blast.
- Rank 0 Melee Exposure is just fine on most builds.
- Rank >0 Exodia Contagion is not necessary.
- If you don't oneshot elements, consider replacing attack speed mods with Organ shatter and/or Primed Pressure Point or modding for more strength.
- The Zaw is Balla+Peye+Vargeet II Jai. If you have a different strike, see [__How to Build A Zaw__](/beginner/creating-builds#zaw-part-setups) for making a Zaw with a different strike.
:::

__Heavy Weapon:__

#### **Mausolon Build**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/Mausolon_Build.png" alt="Mausolon_Build" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/602062/)

- For a Heavy Weapon, it takes 5-6 shots to destroy legs.
- Make sure you have enough health to survive the summon animation.
