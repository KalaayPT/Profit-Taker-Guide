# Basic Builds

*Simple builds that aren’t highly specialized for stuff like Crewmate and Total Eclipse. Builds here are more generalized and less highly specific, at least for frames. You can go to the next section for build crafting. This section allows you to hit the ground running without having to learn EVERYTHING about building.*

We've tried our best to make cheap builds that do extremely well. When copying these builds, replace any Primed Mods you don't have with a Mod of the same effect, and to save Endo and Forma consider running rank 8 Mods instead of rank 10. Feel free to mess around with 'flex' Mods, but **any Mod not listed as 'flex' can be considered mandatory** for these builds to work properly.

## **Chroma builds - Vex Armor**

These builds are for Chroma running Vex Armor. QoL is a priority in this section.  
Suggested Warframe Arcanes include: Velocity, Avenger, Nullifier, Acceleration

#### **Generic Vex Armor (Shock Trooper)**

- This is the generic build for this section, the others are example variations.
- If you have Primed Sure Footed, use it over Handspring. If you want to just run Unairu instead, you can put Preparation in exilus.
- Decaying Dragon Key is recommended to stack your Vex Fury much faster, but you should keep an eye on your health since you won't get the full armor buff from Vex immediately.
- The Umbral Forma isn't necessary if you forma every other slot, but gives you a lot more flexibility for future changes.
- Your main method of healing should be Magus Elevate on operator. If you spam 5-e-5-e you can very quickly heal to full health.
- If energy isn't an issue, replacing Arcane Nullifier with Arcane Avenger is a decent boost to Diplos damage, and a big one to Mausolon damage.
- Rage is a flex Mod. If your runs are fast, Primed Flow with Preparation or amber starting energy archon shards will give you enough energy for the whole run.
- Heat elemental ward gives you the most EHP, along with healing you when you recast. This means you may be able to forego alternate forms of healing in a pinch.
- If heat/cold Elemental Ward isn’t needed for survivability, you can use toxin for more dps, but it is additive with Vex and therefore a minor increase.
- Steel Charge isn’t special aside from the extra capacity, any aura works.
- You can replace Primed Continuity with Narrow Minded if you don't have a crewmate. If you have one, it's highly recommended to not run negative range, as he is very fragile without Vex.
- Starting energy archon shard(s) are highly recommended for the first casts.
- You're expected to run Madurai for damage, and void striking for 2nd leg phase to keep Mausolon cooldown low for 3rd legs. It's somewhat minor, especially in slow runs, so you can replace it with Unairu or Zenurik.

#### **Energized Munitions**

::::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/771334/)

- When not running Shock Trooper, you should do electric shields by Void Striking with Virtuos Surge. 7x7 amp with Eternal Onslaught is recommended.
- Energized Munitions' point is lowering your Archgun Deployer cooldown, as the cooldown is based on ammo spent / max ammo.
- Best archgun with EM is Velocitus, because it can oneshot legs basically as fast as you can click. It doesn't need a great riven to work, but you should at least have one with critical chance so you don't have to rely on Arcane Avenger or luck. Use [the calculator](https://calc.profit-taker.com/) to see if you can oneshot.
- Even with Mausolon, you can find EM useful if your power strength or Mausolon build is lacking.
- EM is quite expensive to cast at 50 base energy cost and 3 expected casts per run.
- Natural Talent is a flex slot.
:::warning
If you're a client in a squad, the ammo efficiency doesn't affect the cooldown even though visually it does. Your archgun will just be unpullable with no error message until the 'real cooldown' is over.

#### **Spellbind**

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/771335/)

- When not running Shock Trooper, you should do electric shields by Void Striking with Virtuos Surge. 7x7 amp with Eternal Onslaught is recommended.
- Spellbind is used to gain full status and knockback immunity without needing Unairu or Primed Sure Footed.
- On top of knockbacks, immunity to the electric status from her sweep attack and puncture procs from adds are useful.
- All the energy in the above build is probably overkill. Depending on your run speeds and polarities you can swap Rage or Primed Flow for whatever you feel like you need, Steel Fiber for example can help you survive early on.

## Weapon Builds - Vex Armor

*The following builds don’t run Damage Mods (other than Amalgam Serration) because Vex Armor is additive with Damage Mods.*

__Primary weapon:__

#### **Kuva Ogris**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/u/pogris_eclipse.png" alt="pogris_eclipse" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/771293/)

- Needs 283+% Strength to kill a pylon in three damage ticks, needs 4 otherwise. Any riven with at least 50% multishot will reduce it to two ticks at 283+%.
- Nightwatch Napalm will damage Pylons as long as they are in range, even through the Pylon bubble.
- Normal Ogris also works well enough if Kuva Ogris feels too grindy. Does less damage (adding Heavy Caliber in place of Vile Acceleration is an option, but makes you miss the pylon sometimes) but only needs one ammo mod. The other one can be replaced with Firestorm on a standard Ogris, for slightly less required accuracy especially if combined with Heavy Caliber.

#### **Zenith Build**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/u/Zenith_Build.png" alt="Zenith_Build" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/771294/)

- Covers toxin 
- Despite Vex Armor giving an additive damage bonus, Amalgam Serration is used for its sprint speed buff. 
- This build relies on multishot to destroy Pylons. 
- Vex Armor needs to be ramped up to oneshot pylons. This is extremely sensitive to any changes in power strength and needs about 278%str or higher to oneshot (achievable with Blind Rage + Umbral Intensify+Vitality + Augur Secrets)
- if you don't need Zenith to do shields, replace the crit mods with more fire rate

__Secondary weapon:__

#### **Sicarus Prime Incarnoff**

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/784344/)

The Successor to Tenet Diplos. Rivens will ideally replace Tox/CC/CD Mods on the build. Cold and Heat are replaceable, but slightly less ideal, due to replacing either Ice Storm with its additional Magazine Capacity or Primed Heated Charge's higher Heat Damage. 

Incarnon Adapter Evos;

EVO II: Feigned Retreat +40 Base Damage

EVO III: Extended Volley +12 Base Magazine Size

EVO IV: Commodore's Fortune +14% Base CC.

- Covers IPS, Magnetic, Radiation, Viral and Heat.
- Use the Exilus that benefits your situation the most.
- Cascadia Overcharge assumes shield pad usage. If you don't use shield pads, use Secondary Enervate.
:::

#### **Tenet Diplos Build**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/u/Vex_Armor_Tenet_Diplos_Build.png" alt="Vex_Armor_Tenet_Diplos_Build" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/771296/)

- Covers heat, magnetic (progenitor) and viral
- Lethal Torrent can be replaced with Accelerated Isotope so you don't have to rely on Contagion for Radiation
- If you don't have Diplos, you can use any weapon with innate (or progenitor) magnetic or any high [crit] damage weapon with the Magnetic Might mod.
- Reflex Draw is flex
- Cascadia Overcharge assumes shield pad usage. If you don't use shield pads, you can use Deadhead for less recoil or Merciless if you are able to build stacks.

__Melee weapon:__

#### **Exodia Contagion Zaw Build**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/u/balla_eclipse.png" alt="Exodia_Contagion_Zaw_Build" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/771297/)

- Covers IPS, cold, radiation, gas, corrosive and blast.
- Rank 0 Melee Exposure is just fine on most builds.
- Rank >0 Exodia Contagion is not necessary.
- If you don't oneshot elements, consider replacing attack speed mods with Organ shatter and/or Primed Pressure Point or modding for more strength.
- The Zaw is Balla+Peye+Vargeet II Jai. If you have a different strike, see [__How to Build A Zaw__](/beginner/creating-builds#zaw-part-setups) for making a Zaw with a different strike.

__Heavy Weapon:__

#### **Mausolon Build**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/u/Mausolon_Build.png" alt="Mausolon_Build" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/771299/)

- For a Heavy Weapon, it takes 5-6 shots to destroy legs.
- Make sure you have enough health to survive the summon animation.
