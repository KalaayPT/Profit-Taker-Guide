# Positioning

Tying in with the previous section, Profit-Taker’s movement and attacks are largely based on your position. Some things directly, others indirectly. With proper positioning, Profit-Taker will sit and stare at you without attacking or moving. A proper landing is the first step of good positioning as the first shield phase is when Profit-Taker is most mobile and likely to turn.

## <u>**Profit-Taker’s attacks and you**</u>

There are three attacks for which we know that they are based on the Player’s position:

### **The EMP Slam attack**

Profit-Taker slams the ground, sending out horizontal magnetic waves in all directions. You can prevent Profit-Taker from using this attack by <u>**not being too close to Profit-Taker**</u>. If she does use the attack, the magnetic waves can easily be avoided by being below or above them.

### **The Laser Sweep attack**
where Profit-Taker fires a massive laser that can deal thousands of damage in as little as three frames. Profit-Taker will only use the attack during or directly after the Shield Phase if you stand directly in front, to the sides, or behind her. If you notice the attack early, it is easy enough to dodge. Keep an eye out for when the legs ‘snap’ into position for the attack and dodge by not being directly in front of her. Don’t eat the lasers, they’re bad for your health.

Profit-Taker only does the Laser Sweep attack during certain phases. During others, she does 
### **The Mortar attack**
In this attack, she shoots a fiery ball in front of her that explodes a few seconds after it hits a surface. Move towards this attack to avoid the worst of the effect.

### **The Leg Zap**
which inflicts an extremely high damage Electric proc that both destroys your shield gating and can affect teammates with unavoidable damage over time. Profit-Taker will only use this attack when you are in front of one of her legs.

*As you can see in the gif, the laser attack doesn’t just come from the front*

*Red is the laser attack, blue is the leg zap. Smile is the front*

Profit-Taker also has a couple of extremely annoying attacks that seem to be influenced by your position, but it's extremely precise.

### The **Bounce** 
appears to happen when you get too close to Profit-Taker during Armor and Pylon Phase. It shoots you away from Profit-Taker and is the only knockback to effect Mech. Rolling or bullet jumping into the bounce minimizes knockback. There is a guaranteed bounce while the first pylons are launching if you are close enough to profit taker. Being bounced during second legs can be avoided via the [__Push Strat__](/advanced/speedrun-strats.html#push-strat).

### **The Blue Walls** 
knock you back when you collide with them and can block Zenith shots. These appear to trigger more often when you’re beyond a certain distance from Profit-Taker and don't happen as much if the EMP slam or bounce attack happens.  
**How to deal with blue walls:** While Blue Walls are spawning, you will see light blue seams between walls. You can move and shoot through these seams. If you can’t reach a seam in time, roll into the wall as it hits you to avoid getting knocked back. Each wall can only hit you once, so once you roll into one you can walk through it like it isn’t there.

Try to stay just inside the distance blue walls spawn from, while staying outside of the bounce range.  A good range to aim for is about  25 m away from the main body. This will minimize both bounces and blue walls

## <u>Profit-Taker movement and you:</u>

<u>**The most important thing to do is stay in front of Profit-Taker.**</u> If she targets someone more than 10-20 degrees off directly in front of her, she will turn to face them. This is generally a bad thing, as it can quickly ruin your ability to shoot some limbs (especially if you’re using mech) and you will be generally unable to reliably hit precise spots while Profit-Taker is moving. Volt is most sensitive to Profit-Taker moving due to his shields, which block a lot of the damage from Profit-Taker while being essential to many parts of the meta setup.

TL;DR: For best results, stay in the green area when not playing Volt, since Volt’s shields protect him from the laser attack. The yellow area is where the laser attack happens, if you’re outside of the green area, Profit-Taker will turn to face you.

If you position yourself correctly, Profit-Taker will just sit and stare at you while doing minimal attacks.

:::info Note:
Profit-Taker has a Chin Turret that seems to target the Player/Specter closest to the orb, dealing massive damage. Can be blocked by Volt’s shield.
