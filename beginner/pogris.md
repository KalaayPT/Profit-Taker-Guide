# Pogris

Pogris is the name Speedrunners have given to using a Kuva Ogris with Nightwatch Napalm to take care of pylons. This can destroy pylons as they land, and damage pylons that have already landed, making this overall the fastest and most forgiving method of clearing pylons.

### **Why Pogris?**

What Pogris brings to the table is briefly described and demonstrated [earlier](/beginner/creating-builds.html#kuva-ogris) in Creating Builds when going over potential pylon weapons, but the gist is as follows:

Nightwatch napalm is an Ogris augment mod that leaves a damage-over-time effect where the rockets land which can damage pylons. By using this to our advantage, it is possible to destroy pylons as they land, massively speeding up solo pylons and dethroning a long-standing pillar of Profit-Taker speedrunning, the Zenith. To understand why, let's look at the advantages and disadvantages of using Pogris, and what can be done about the disadvantages.

> [!IMPORTANT] Advantages:
> In solos, Pogris is several seconds faster than the fastest solo Zenith time and allows one person using Pogris to do the work of an entire squad using Zenith.
> It is also significantly more comfortable and forgiving than Zenith.

:::danger Disadvantages:

Kuva Ogris cannot deal enough damage to Profit-Taker’s shields with a Pogris build, however, this isn’t a major problem when using the On Call strats mentioned [__later__](/advanced/speedrun-strats.html#on-call-strats), as they can cover all of Zenith’s elements without any time loss from having to swap weapons. Swapping weapons loses over half a second, and this is extremely bad in shield phases that ideally take under a second once damage starts being dealt. All in all, this is a disadvantage that is already mitigated.

However, there is another major drawback to Pogris: there is very little build variety for Kuva Ogris and Frame at the high end. This is elaborated upon more in Builds (see below), but TL;DR: without a good riven, Volt needs multiple red archon shards, maxed sling strength from the Madurai focus school, no QoL mods, and there’s only one viable Pogris build  (maybe 2 if you stretch it), with what amounts to three mods of options. This means that if you’re using the meta builds and you just can’t get fast enough to survive or you don’t want to spam energy & shield pads, you’re SoL.

### **Builds**

Rivenless Pogris build (Which element it is doesn't matter, however what bonus% it is, matters)

[*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/602193/)

This build needs 427% strength with subsumed Eclipse, Vengeful Archwing and Arcane Rise/Vigorous Swap to 3-tick pylons consistently (will need 4 ticks otherwise).

:::info Note:
The Strength requirements can be offset somewhat by replacing Speed Trigger with Semi-Rifle Cannonade
:::

This build consists of:

- Magazine so you have enough ammo to destroy all 6 pylons in the second phase
- Multishot for 2 reliable rockets
- Terminal Velocity because rockets are slow
- Amalgam Serration because it’s a massive speed boost.
- Fire rate because Ogris has low fire rate.
- Fractalized Reset: procs off of a lot of things, most notably: Transference, Warframe abilities and Archwing abilities. Will make reloads near instant as Volt and can be useful for double-shotting Pylons considering the limited Magazine on the Kuva Ogris

Here are your mod options for this build:

- If you use Void Strike to do the second pylon phase, you dont need to equip Tainted Mag, since Void Strike gives more than enough ammo efficiency to shoot all pylons
- Empty slot can be filled with a riven or Heavy Caliber. We highly recommend NOT using Heavy Caliber, because while it offsets the strength, the accuracy penalty is *extremely** noticeable.
- Speed Trigger can be replaced by Vile Acceleration, but you’ll need x% more strength to oneshot, or more damage rivens or frame. Vile Accel can also be put in the empty slot
- Speed Trigger can also be replaced by Semi-Rifle Cannonade, offsetting strength requirements

Here are the ranges of required power strength with various setups:

Here’s what you can do on Frame and elsewhere to boost your Pogris damage beyond power strength mods:

- Madurai Void Strike gives +1000% damage and is a good option for consistently oneshotting all pylons in the second pylon phase
- Arcane Rise gives a 150% damage mod, with reload on holster effects reliably triggering its 60% proc chance due to the gradual reload.
- Railjack intrinsic “Vengeful Archwing” (Gunnery 8) gives you an additional 25% damage while in archwing. Will not apply to projectiles that hit after leaving archwing
- Red archon shards can give you up to 50% power strength. 75% with Tauforged.
- Sling Strength from the Madurai focus school can give you up to 40% power strength.
- Vigorous Swap gives you a 165% damage mod, massively lowering power strength requirements/allowing you to run some better mods. This triggers when leaving archwing, so it synergizes well with the “Vengeful Archwing” intrinsic.
- Rifle Amp gives you a 27% bonus, offsetting mods like vile acceleration and decreasing power strength requirements.
- Molt Vigor gives you a 45% power strength bonus, however, you have to be careful to cast Eclipse afterward.

### **During the Fight**

When it comes time for pylon phases, recast your abilities as normal, then fly up. As always, attempt to minimize how much time you spend moving, the time you spend moving is time you spend not shooting pylon landing spots.

The higher you are, the easier it is to consistently see where all the pylons are going, so while it is important to not go so high that it takes forever to reach the ground, it’s better to be too high than too low.

#### Pylon Locations
Pylon landing locations are fairly predictable, and it’s just a matter of knowing where they can land. They only have a few set spots they can land, so there isn’t much guesswork to it.

Here are most of the common pylon spawn locations marked on shrooms and lake spawns:

Once you’ve shot all the pylon landing locations, return to where you took off from to avoid turning Profit-Taker. If you’ve done it right, you’ll have a small amount of time to prepare for the next phase. Make sure you swap to secondary before trying to do shield phases.
