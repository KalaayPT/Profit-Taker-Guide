# Landing

For reasons given in the next section, your landing is one of the most important parts of the fight. A good landing sets up the rest of the run, and a bad landing will lose several seconds as the run progresses.

There are two general categories of landing: hard and soft. Soft landings are faster but harder to do and tend to become impractically precise as Archwing speed increases. Hard landings add some time loss but are quite simple.

For all landings, you want to be flying straight and level in Archwing, then leave early enough that you have time to cast your abilities and launch Zenith’s disc before you hit the ground.

See how when leaving Archwing I’m flying straight, not up or down? At the speeds of an Archwing, slight variations in trajectory can mean the difference between a controlled landing, massively overshooting, and quickly slamming into the ground.

## **Soft Landing**

A soft landing is when you hit the ground and can immediately start attacking Profit-Taker, any speed boosts generally make you too fast to come to a stop in time with the traditional soft landing.

To do a traditional non-Speed boosted soft landing, fly straight and level, exit Archwing such that you’ll hit the ground on an uphill, then hit slide when you hit the hill and use the slope to slow you down. You can then start throwing Contagion.

Abilities like Eclipse slow you down if you land while casting it, and should therefore be finished before you land.

### Mountain

For Mountain, blink up and towards the spawn such that you’re at the right height for landing, and blink once more on the way over. Exit Archwing around the rocks you pass over right before spawn, and slide up the side of the hill.

### Lake

For Lake, fly straight to where you want to land, there should be time for 3 blinks. The entire landing zone is uphill so this is the easiest landing to do.

### Shrooms

For shrooms, take a straight line through enrichment labs until you reach the crater rim, then turn into the landing so you have a good angle to land on the hill.

## **Hard Landing (Volt)**

A hard landing is when you land by doing a slam attack. This is almost necessary for Volt and squad runs due to the sheer number of speed boosts available. A full squad of Sprint Boosts is enough to make a soft landing difficult.

It is possible to cancel the slam attack by casting Volt speed, saving a few fractions of a second

### Mountain

First fly up while holding W, then do a blink after you line up with Profit-Taker. This saves about 0.2s when compared to blinking straight from elevator.

### Lake

Blink forward to the spawn, don't blink up or too far down or you'll hit the cliff.

Land near the left of Profit-Taker as it'll move to the left. This will help get a good angle to hit legs.

### Shrooms

Blink towards the spawn, don't go too high up, make sure you exit archwing early and leave enough time to cast Eclipse.

::: info Notes:
- During landing, you should not double jump or roll. Neither improves your velocity.

- It is better to leave Archwing too soon rather than too late. If you’re too late, you’ll always overshoot your target. If you’re too soon, you can compensate by aim gliding.

- If you’re using a Necramech for Armor phase, try to spawn it while landing, this will save several fractions of a second.

- Sometimes, the Necramech doesn’t spawn where you aim. This happens when you try to summon it too quickly after a big change in aim, like when you land. If you can find it, you can simply move to it and transference into your mech. Otherwise, you’ll have to deal with the 10s cooldown on the Necramech Summon.  
- As a client, one of the reasons the Necramech doesn’t spawn where you aim is because spawning mech is done by the host, not the client. You can avoid misplaced Necramechs by waiting a fraction of a second after sudden movements to give the host time to update your position and orientation.

- If you’re using your On Call Crewmate to cover all your elements, summon it while landing.

- In Archwing, you lose some speed when double tapping sprint to blink because you stop sprinting for a fraction of a second. For maximum speed when flying to Profit-Taker, set a separate roll keybind.
