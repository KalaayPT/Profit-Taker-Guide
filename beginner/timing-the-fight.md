# Timing The fight

The Timer starts on the frame the minimap changes from the elevator to the Vallis, as seen in the following images:

In elevator:

Out of elevator:

</div>

And the timer ends when Profit-Taker flashes blue upon death as seen in the image:

Profit-Taker spawns at 8s on the in-game timer. Note that the in-game timer will reset once Warframe finishes loading the bounty, which takes \~4s on a good PC. This can take longer on slower systems. To get the most accurate time, stay in the elevator until this timer hits 8s after resetting. Only the hostâ€™s timer resets. This system helps avoid giving an unfair advantage to people with an extremely good PC.

As host, you can estimate your time by subtracting 8 seconds from the timer at the moment Profit-Taker dies, or you can track your time with the [__Profit-Taker Analyzer.__](https://basi.is-a.dev/pta/)
