# **Solo Speedrun Builds**

*These builds differ from basic builds in some notable ways due to stuff like the expected skill of the user and utilized tools. Builds that seek to buff certain things explicitly at the cost of other things normally seen as essential belong here.*

**Please do not mindlessly copy these builds. As a rule, they are extremely specialized. Read the descriptions, and ask any further questions in the discord.**

## **Credit Farming Setup**

There's 2 chroma builds that are pretty even, one with Shock Trooper, one with Energized Munitions. When it comes to speedrun.com legal runs, I believe Shock Trooper with a good Corvas riven is the best choice, but also requires a very good riven. When using gravimag I believe Energized Munitions Velocitus has a higher ceiling, but is a lot more rng reliant on shield cycle rng.
Remember to use Decaying Dragon Key.

The Shock Trooper build is for running either mech Corvas, or gravimag Mausolon. You get to have all elements without needing to think about electric and doing it with amp, making shield rng much less painful. If you run Mausolon, you should definitely have Arcane Avenger, but with Corvas it's less mandatory and can be replaced with Nullifier. At good speed you shouldn't have energy problems though even with a magnetic proc or two. Archon shards should be starting energy and str.
With Mausolon I recommend Void Striking before 2nd legs to make sure the cooldown is back up for 3rd legs.
Mausolon build is the same as in [basic builds.](https://profit-taker.com/beginner/vex-armor-builds#mausolon-build)

Note that this build isn't speedrun.com legal because Virtuos Surge killing an entire shield is technically a bug. You can make it legal by loading cold or electric onto your companion but it is not reliable at all.
Energized Munitions is for enabling gravimag Velocitus, which is by far the fastest archgun. With Ammo Chain on the velocitus, your cooldown should be around 2s per ammo spent. You should have a riven with at least critical chance on it if you don't want to rely on Arcane Avenger. With some bonus damage from Riven, you can quite easily run blessless while slotting Automatic Trigger on the Velocitus. [Use the calculator to check if you can oneshot.](https://calc.profit-taker.com/)
Main con of the build is that you can't do electric with Shock Trooper, so you must do it with your amp. You use 7x7, Virtuos Surge, Eternal Onslaught and Void Strike. If you're close to PT it does more damage than from max range. Basically you're hoping for an electric shield early into shield phase 2, so you can kill the whole shield with the amp. If you didn't get an electric shield in phase 1, you can pre-cast Void Strike between the 2nd legs and bodyshot.
You want to use cast speed archon shards to make the EM cast animation shorter. At least 2 are recommended. If it first your polarities better, you can use Natural Talent over Preparation and slot starting energy shards instead.
Arcane Nullifier is recommended if you want to run completely padless, as the casts are quite expensive. Arcane Avenger isn't mandatory but helps your Diplos DPS.

**Less Umbral formas:**

You will have less power strength, but you can replace any umbral mods with their regular versions. Chroma is rather tanky already, especially if you use elemental ward for defense purposes, so the lack of Umbral Vitality/Fiber shouldn’t hurt much. You can also consider replacing Fiber with utility like Natural Talent.

**No Primed Sure Footed:**

If you don’t have PSF, you can replace it with Handspring or just run without knockdown resist and slot Preparation instead. At fast pace and with a crewmate the knockdowns are less of an issue than you might expect.

### **Operator**

To make the best use of the Operator element coverage, Madurai is essential. Void Strike gives you a massive damage increase while also emptying your Operator energy, therefore guaranteeing Eternal Onslaught in the process. The best weapon to use is a Klamora - Certus (7x7) Amp because of its continuous high damage output.

### **Volt**

[*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/610238/)

Low duration Volt build. The higher range is so Total Eclipse more reliably buffs On Call Crew. Amar’s Hatred is a flex slot for this build and only used because of its polarity, because these polarities are compatible with both Eidolon and Arbitration builds. Relies on Ancient Healer Specter and/or shield pads to stay alive.

Natural Talent can be replaced with Augur Secrets and yellow archon shards or cast speed can be dropped altogether. Primed Sure footed can be replaced with Power Drift past a certain pace as knockdowns become increasingly rare and Wyrm can pick up the slack. Unairu is also an option if using power drift or if you don’t have PSF. Arcane Awakening is flex and can be replaced by either Molt Efficiency if you need more duration or Arcane Guardian if you have trouble staying alive.

## **Weapon Builds**

### **Kuva Ogris**

[*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/610245/)

Kuva Ogris is entirely for pylons. Magazine size mods are so that you have enough shots for all pylons. Damage and multishot on riven lets you always twotick with decent power strength (rip Eclipse). Projectile speed gives the most QoL out of any third stat.

### **Zenith**

**This weapon is now defunct due to the speed and ease of use of Kuva Ogris. You can see it in old versions of the guide [__here__](/miscellaneous/resources-used-honorable-mentions.html).**

### **Tenet Diplos**

[*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/396859/)

Tenet Diplos doesn’t have much build variety. This build expects riven to have both toxin and cold, however, a riven with only one of the two will work, in which case replace Accelerated Isotope with the missing element. Diplos uses magnetic progenitor.

High attack speed build, it saves a few milliseconds. Volt shield, Vigorous Swap, and Eclipse makes damage-increasing mods unnecessary. The riven goes over one of the elemental mods for gas and cold, in this example it replaces the heat mod and is otherwise only for increasing attack speed.

[*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/621203/)

For Shock Trooper Chroma. You want a riven that lets you at least oneshot at full charge. Check the [calculator.](https://calc.profit-taker.com)

### **Mech Velocitus**

[*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/705996/)

This build and riven needs damage bless and a volt shield to oneshot. Info about viable riven rolls can be found in the [Riven guide](/advanced/riven-guide.html#velocitus-with-crit-chance)

Explained in [__on call strats__](/advanced/speedrun-strats.html#on-call-strats), only works well with +150% primary cc crewmate. Make sure your crewmate isn’t behind your mech.

### **Gravimag Velocitus**

[*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/769758/)

For Energized Munitions Chroma. If you believe in Arcane Avenger, you can even run rivenless. You should have CC on riven for consistency, but it doesn't need great danage rolls to oneshot. If you lack damage, you can drop Automatic Trigger. Check the [calculator.](https://calc.profit-taker.com)
