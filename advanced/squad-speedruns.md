# **Squad Speedruns**

## **Roles**

### <u>Volt</u>

![Squad Volt](https://cdn.profit-taker.com/u/Squad_Volt.png)

::::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/814126/volt-prime/squad-builds-volt-prime-eclipse/)

The build for Volt is nearly identical to the solo speedrun setup. Eclipse is subsumed over his 4th ability. Volt's role is to speed up landing/flight and to break first shields and legs. Mech Velocitus will be used for first legs, the riven requirement is much less strict than in solo due to Jade's buff. Critical chance is still mandatory, depending on the strength of the Deathbringer buff you can run up to 3 fire rate modifiers. There is also the option to drop Primed Dual Rounds for Magnetised Cycle which removes Multishot bugs/issues. 

After first legs Volt handles pylons and places shields for both electric element coverage and damage increase. The on-call crewmate should run Kuva Chakkhurr, which can oneshot toxin shields without the need of Total Eclipse.
Madurai Void Strike is used for 2nd pylons for the ammo efficiency rather than the damage buff.

### <u>Mirage</u>

::::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/814124/mirage-prime/squad-builds-mirage-prime-shooting-gallery/)

Mirage takes the role of gunner, and handles the last 3 leg phases. Subsume Energized Munitions over her 4th ability to allow her to upkeep fire even with a strong Wisp Haste Mote present. Use Rauta to quickly stack combo for Secondary Outburst on your Prisma Dual Decurions. Pull out your Archgun just before the first pylons land to ensure the Outburst buff lasts the entire fight. If there is no space for Mirage in the squad, Jade using Prisma Dual Decurions (or Mausolon in duo) is the preferred option.

### <u>Chroma</u>

::::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/814133/chroma-prime/squad-builds-chroma-prime-nourish/)

Chroma doubles the credit drops after the fight, and can help with shields using Sicarus and Balla. In case Volt misses a pylon he can run Zenith to quickly clean up. Vex Armour provides a further damage boost. Heat Elemental Ward increases the Arcane Bellicose buff across the squad.

### <u>Jade</u>

![Squad Jade](https://cdn.profit-taker.com/u/Squad_Jade.png)

::::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/814139/jade/squad-builds-jade-roar/)

Jade can provide a large damage buff to Necramechs, which enables Volt to run extra fire rate mods on Velocitus during the first leg phase. If Volt is sufficiently skilled, this is a consistent timesave. Jade has to cast Deathbringer as soon as possible during landing, ideally during flight or in the elevator. Deathbringer's range is 250m in open worlds, so Jade can land a little after Volt. Use Rauta to quickly stack combo for Secondary Outburst on your Prisma Dual Decurions. Pull out your Archgun just before the first pylons land to ensure the Outburst buff lasts the entire fight.

### <u>Wisp</u>

![Squad Wisp](https://cdn.profit-taker.com/u/Squad_Wisp.png)

::::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/814120/wisp-prime/squad-builds-wisp-prime-roar/)

Wisp enables the squad to run Arcane Bellicose for a free strength increase. Fused Reservoir speeds up the mote placement, allowing for more survivability, strength, fire rate + attack speed, and some crowd control with shock mote. Prebuff your initial mote with Madurai Sling Strength and Molt Vigor, then place a second mote after receiving the Bellicose buff. A haste mote can be placed at the elevator to speed up the flight to Profit Taker. Brightbonnet is subsumed over her 4th ability, which provides a large strength buff and sufficient energy for the entire run. Brightbonnet can be placed at the elevator to allow the entire squad to run without energy pads.

Excluding Volt, all roles can use Kuva Zarr on their On-call Crewmates, this weapon doesn't damage Profit Taker, but is very effective at killing trash enemies.
Opticor Vandal is also a good option, especially in faster squads where trash enemies are less annoying.

Do not drop Ancient Healer specters and ideally park all crewmates to avoid slam attacks. Amalgam Serration should be equipped on primary weapons to increase flight speed in Archwing.

## Weapons

### **Archguns (Legs)**

#### **Build - all Archguns**

</div>

Mausolon, Prisma Dual Decurions and Imperator Vandal are viable options depending on your squad, sorted by damage potential. An ideal squad riven has crit chance, fire rate and negative zoom (both Imperator and Decurions have very narrow FOVs). Secondary Outburst can be stacked by Rauta and lets gunners hit >100% crit chance without a riven.

Imperator [Vandal] and [Prisma] Dual Decurions suffer from [Archgun Hitbox Bug](/miscellaneous/bugs#archgun-hitbox-bug) so they can't take advantage of Volt's shield.

### Support Weapons (Shields)

In general, Chroma and/or Wisp running the same shield setup as in solo (Sicarus+Balla) always works. Blast+Toxin can be modded on Sicarus to help consistently cover elements. 

In terms of overall element setups, supports should aim to run elements that are typically either not covered (toxin) or relegated to Contagion: Blast, Corrosive, Gas, Cold. This is mainly because with lower FPS in squads, contagion throws get slower too.
