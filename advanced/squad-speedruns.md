## **Roles**

### <u>Volt</u>

::::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/814126/volt-prime/squad-builds-volt-prime-eclipse/)

The build for Volt is nearly identical to the solo speedrun setup. Eclipse is subsumed over his 4th ability. Volt's role is to speed up landing/flight and to break first shields and legs. Mech Velocitus will be used for first legs, the riven requirement is much less strict than in solo due to Jade's buff. Critical chance is still mandatory, depending on the strength of the Deathbringer buff you can run up to 3 fire rate modifiers. 

After first legs Volt handles pylons and places shields for both electric element coverage and damage increase. The on-call crewmate should run Kuva Chakkhurr, which can oneshot toxin shields without the need of Total Eclipse.
Madurai Void Strike is used for 2nd pylons for the ammo efficiency rather than the damage buff.

### <u>Mirage</u>

::::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/814124/mirage-prime/squad-builds-mirage-prime-shooting-gallery/)

Mirage takes the role of gunner, and handles the last 3 leg phases. She subsumes Shooting Gallery over her 4th ability as that is the only way to boost damage without replacing Eclipse. Use Prisma Dual Decurions or Imperator Vandal for extremely fast leg breaks. Vazarin Protective Sling provides easy survivability. Arcane Avenger is only required on rivenless archguns. If there is no space for Mirage in the squad, she can be replaced with Jade using Mausolon.

### <u>Chroma</u>

::::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/814133/chroma-prime/squad-builds-chroma-prime-nourish/)

Chroma doubles the credit drops after the fight, and can help with shields using Sicarus and Balla. Nourish subsumed over his first ability in combination with the Zenurik Focus School allows the squad to run without needing to spend energy pads. In case Volt misses a pylon he can run Zenith to quickly clean up. Vex Armour provides a further damage boost. Heat Elemental Ward increases the Arcane Bellicose buff across the squad.

### <u>Jade</u>

![Squad Jade](https://cdn.profit-taker.com/u/Squad_Jade.png)

::::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/814139/jade/squad-builds-jade-roar/)

Jade can provide a large damage buff to Necramechs, which enables Volt to run extra fire rate mods on Velocitus during the first leg phase. If Volt is sufficiently skilled, this is a consistent timesave. Jade has to cast Deathbringer as soon as possible during landing, ideally during flight. Deathbringer's range is 250m in open worlds, so Jade can land a little after Volt.
In less experienced squads, Wisp will provide more buffs and survivability across the run. Both Jade and Wisp subsume Roar over their 4th abilities, and run Torid in their primary slot to handle toxin shields, with Sicarus and Balla for everything else.

### <u>Wisp</u>

::::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/814120/wisp-prime/squad-builds-wisp-prime-roar/)

Wisp enables the squad to run Arcane Bellicose for a free strength increase. Fused Reservoir speeds up the mote placement, allowing for more survivability, strength, fire rate + attack speed, and some crowd control with shock mote. Prebuff your initial mote with Madurai Sling Strength and Molt Vigor, then place a second mote after receiving the Bellicose buff. A haste mote can be placed at the elevator to speed up the flight to Profit Taker.

Excluding Volt, all roles can use Kuva Zarr on their On-call Crewmates, this weapon doesn't damage Profit Taker, but is very effective at killing trash enemies. 

Do not drop Ancient Healer specters and ideally park all crewmates to avoid slam attacks. Amalgam Serration should be equipped on primary weapons to increase flight speed in Archwing.

## Weapons

### **Archguns**

#### **Build - all Archguns (Legs)**

    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/u/imperatorriven.png" alt="imperatorriven" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Mausolon, Prisma Dual Decurions and Imperator Vandal are viable options depending on your squad, sorted by damage potential. An ideal squad riven has crit chance, fire rate and negative zoom (both Imperator and Decurions have very narrow FOVs)

Imperator [Vandal] and [Prisma] Dual Decurions suffer from [Archgun Hitbox Bug](/miscellaneous/bugs#archgun-hitbox-bug) so they can't take advantage of Volt's shield.

#### Support Weapons (Shields)

In general, running the same shield setup as in solo (Sicarus+Balla) always works. In squads running a Wisp, ammo economy becomes a problem for Sicarus, making Diplos a viable alternative. If not proficient or not wanting to do contagion, a beam weapon like the [Coda] Synapse or any similary high fire rate high crit weapon for just holding fire works well. [Torid](https://overframe.gg/build/771316/) (previously used for Crewmates in older metas) is also very valuable here and should be ran by at least one person to make sure that toxin is always covered, although other elements can be modded as well.

In terms of overall element setups, supports should aim to run elements that are typically either not covered (toxin) or relegated to Contagion: Blast, Corrosive (see [Synapse](https://overframe.gg/build/396871/)/[Catabolyst](https://overframe.gg/build/518597/), previously used on Crewmates), Gas, Cold.
