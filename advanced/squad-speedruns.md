# **Squad Speedruns**

:::warning Note:
this section will be updated at some point to reflect the current meta for squads (particularly, using Jade because of her ability to buff Necramechs, allowing Volt to run double/triple fire rate on Velocitus). Everything on this page is still viable though.

## **Roles**

*Squad strats aren’t fully optimized yet, there are still debatable choices. If you’re interested in finding new strats or wanna run with other people, we welcome you to join [__our discord server__](https://discord.profit-taker.com)*

A coordinated PT squad needs to focus on a few different things for a squad run to make good use of the additional manpower.

Generally, squads make use of at least one Archgunner, meaning one player who arrives at the orb and calls down a heavy weapon (or does an archlanding / uses Nova). The main reason for this is that an archgun in heavy weapon mode can receive warframe buffs like Eclipse, Roar or Wisp’s Haste Motes, allowing you to run a weapon with higher fire rate and lower damage to break legs faster. Since a dedicated archgunner can stay in archgun mode throughout the entire fight, it's possible to make full use of the advantages that heavy weapon archguns have over necramech archguns. Imperator Vandal (fell out of favor due to [__archgun hitbox bug__](/miscellaneous/bugs.html#archgun-hitbox-bug)) is usually the archgun of choice, since it has the highest fire rate.

### **Volt**

</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/771318/)

- Volt provides essential speed buffs and damage amplification.
- He runs Eclipse and deploys shields to increase squad damage by a lot.
- Runs the same build as in solo, Total Eclipse can be removed for more str.
:::

### **Mirage**

</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/771319/)

- Mirage's clones significantly boost Archgun damage output.
- Duration is tweaked to make one cast of Eclipse last the entire fight.
- Shooting Gallery subsume for some extra damage without replacing Eclipse
- Can also be utilized for Pylons after Eclipse nerf, as Mirage retains the original Eclipse strength and can still oneshot Pylons. If 2 Mirages are used, one can subsume Roar.
:::

### **Chroma**

</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/771320/)

- Chroma offers unique utility with damage buffs (including toxin Elemental Ward) and credit doubling abilities.
- Power Donation aura to buff the squad and fit the mod polarity
:::

### **Wisp**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/u/wispbuild.png" alt="wispbuild" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/771321/)

- Wisp increases fire rate and flight speed, enhancing shield and leg performance.
- She can run Roar or Empower based on if an additional pylon Mirage is used.
- Piercing Roar is used to make sure everyone gets the buff.
- Wisp can put down Reservoirs right after leaving elevator with enough casting speed (shards) to speed up the flight further
:::

### **Nova**

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;">
    <img src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/u/novabuild.png" alt="novabuild" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

:::info [*__Overframe Link__*](https://overframe.gg/build/771322/)

- Nova's portals enable her to teleport to Profit Taker’s spawn with an archgun in hand
- She's best suited for lake spawn and must be the host to be viable.
- See demonstration in [__untapped potential__](/advanced/untapped-potential)
:::

## **Subsumes**

- Subsumed abilities augment squad performance, often focusing on maximizing damage output.
- Common combinations include Eclipse on Volt and Roar on Archgunner.
- Other options include Empower on Wisp, toxin Elemental Ward, or Shooting Gallery.

## **Archguns**

### **Build - all Archguns**

</div>

Nowadays, Mausolon is more viable than Imperator, because of [Archgun Hitbox Bug](/miscellaneous/bugs#archgun-hitbox-bug). Build stays the same.

## **Squad Pylons**

**This section discusses strategies for targeting pylons as a squad and is now defunct due to Pogris. You can still see it in older versions of the guide that you can find [__here__](/miscellaneous/resources-used-honorable-mentions.html).**
