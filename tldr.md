## How the fight works

The Profit-Taker bossfight has three disticnt phases that repeat like this:

Shield → Armor → Pylon → 

Armor → 

Shield → Armor → Pylon → 

Shield → Armor → Death

:::info So the procedure looks like this:
- You land, use Your weapons to take the shield down, then use an archgun to destroy the legs (making PT fall) and body.
- Profit-Taker shoots out pylons, you destroy those and repeat the process
:::

## Prerequisites

To be able to do the Profit-Taker boss in the first place, you need to be max rank with Solaris United and have finished the first three phases of the Profit-Taker heist.

## Gear

### Overview

:::info With Profit-Taker's gimmick being that you can only ever do damage with a given element, the setup looks like this:

- Primary: used either exclusively (Ogris) or mainly (Zenith) for pylons.
- Melee: any Zaw with <b>Exodia Contagion</b> (make sure you can reach 100% crit chance). This is because Contagion turns Zaws into incredibly strong projectile weapons that can both be used very quickly and cover a lot of elements because of how Exodia contagion works, more on that a bit later
- Secondary: any high damage secondary works, but because of the innate elements on a Contagion Zaw, you want one that has innate magnetic damage (a lich weapon or a Synoid Gammacor). The weapon of choice therefore is [Tenet Diplos](/beginner/vex-armor-builds#tenet-diplos-build). More on the element distribution in a second.
- Archgun: can be used either in hand (see [Mausolon](#archgun-mausolon) lower down) or in mech (see [Corvas](#archgun-corvas) lower down). The easier option is usually to do mech, since it doesn't leave you in the open during the pull down animation and during the destroying of the legs
:::

:::tip The expected distribution of elements looks like this (taken from [Creating builds](/beginner/creating-builds#shields)):

Secondary: Viral(Cold+**Toxin**), Heat, innate Mag

Melee (Contagion): Gas(**Toxin**\+Heat), Cold, innate IPS, Blast (innate to Exodia Contagion), Corrosive (covered by Melee Exposure), and Radiation

[__Operator__](/advanced/speedrun-strats.html#operator-element)/Volt Shield: Electric

With this combination, you're only missing Toxin, and there is no way to fit it in the builds without creating the need to switch to your primary.

#### Primary: [Ogris](/beginner/vex-armor-builds#kuva-ogris)

Video demonstration (17&thinsp;mb):
<div style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
<video width="100%" controls>
 <source type="video/mp4" src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/Just%20Use%20The%20Ogris-10.mp4">
</video>
</div>

You should usually only need one shot if your buffs (Vex Armor on Chroma, Eclipse on anything else) are up. The Nightwatch Napalm damage ticks will finish it for you.

The Ogris is the weapon of choice because it's both simple to use and easy to get. You can use either variant, although the Kuva variant is preferred due to it dealing more damage. A very basic but funtional build is also shown in the video. For more info about how it works, click [here](/beginner/pogris) and for a proper build with more info, click [here](/beginner/vex-armor-builds#kuva-ogris) or, if you want to get a riven for it (or have one already), [this](/advanced/solo-speedrun-builds#kuva-ogris) might be the build you want.

#### Secondary: [Diplos](/beginner/vex-armor-builds#tenet-diplos-build)

![diplers](https://cdn.profit-taker.com/Vex_Armor_Tenet_Diplos_Build.png)

not a lot to be said here, you just shoot between contagion throws.

#### Zaw

Example Build:
![zaw](https://cdn.profit-taker.com/balla_eclipse.png)

Exodia Contagion is thrown by double jumping, aim gliding, and meleeing. This allows you to shoot your secondary while you fall after throwing your zaw, when you do it quickly.

Here is a slow demonstration of what the button presses look like (7&thinsp;mb): 
<div style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
<video width="100%" controls>
 <source type="video/mp4" src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/Contagion%20Example%20Slow-1.mp4">
</video>
</div>

Here is a real life example of quickly throwing and shooting (7&thinsp;mb):
<div style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
<video width="100%" controls>
 <source type="video/mp4" src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/Contagion%20Example-3.mp4">
</video>
</div>
I use the scroll wheel to jump and i shoot with 2 in this example. This allows me to do the contagion-shooting-loop very quickly.

#### Archgun: [Mausolon](/beginner/vex-armor-builds#mausolon-build)

![maus](https://cdn.profit-taker.com/Mausolon_Build.png)

Benefits from Warframe buffs such as Vex Armor or Reinforced bond, is limited by long call down animation and ammo economy. If you waste too many bullets, you will have to deal with long cooldowns.

#### Archgun: [Corvas <span style="color: red;">(non-Prime)</span>](/beginner/other-builds#corvas-build-non-prime)

![cornbass](https://cdn.profit-taker.com/corvas_mech.png)
Allows You to survive more easily, does not have to deal with cooldowns. Usually slightly more annoying to use because of a higher aiming point and the mech being completely unbuffed.

### Warframe: Chroma

Here is an example build for Chroma (see more linked above): 
![chroma build](https://cdn.profit-taker.com/Parasitic_Armor_Vex_Armor.png)

For best credit gains, you need at least one [Chroma](/beginner/vex-armor-builds) in your squad. To make sure you actually benefit from it, you might as well run it yourself.

Chroma has the ability to double credits (double dipping with things like credit blessing) by picking up credits in range of his effigy ability, see [How To Place Effigy](/beginner/vex-armor-builds#effigy-placement) for how you can place it. 
:::warning Attention:
Make sure not to walk away from your Effigy after you have placed it. The credit doubling only works when you are in range (about 10&thinsp;m) of it.
:::

:::info See more build notes [here](/beginner/vex-armor-builds#parasitic-armor)
This build utilizes the Parasitic Armor Helminth Ability to remove shields, making it easier to both stack the Vex Armor damage buff and survive.
- You <u>don't</u> need a triumbral build, this is just an example that helps with survivability. You can also use Adaptation.
- Both the empty slot and VigSwap are flex slots, as VigSwap doesn't actually do much for Chroma, with his Vex Armor ability being the same additive damage multiplier 
- Flex slots can be filled with more strength or duration (e.g. Augur Message/Secrets), or other QoL mods if needed. 
- Arcane Velocity very noticably affects Your secondaries' performance and is therefore a must-get if you are going to invest into farming Profit-Taker, other useful Arcanes include (but are not limited to): Guardian, Awakening, Grace.
