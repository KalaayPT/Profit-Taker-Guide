## How the fight works

The Profit-Taker bossfight has three distinct phases (Shields, Armor and Pylons) that repeat like this:

Shield → Armor → Pylon → 

Armor → 

Shield → Armor → Pylon → 

Shield → Armor → Death

:::info So the procedure looks like this:
- You land, use Your weapons to take the shield down, then use an archgun to destroy the legs (making PT fall) and body.
- Profit-Taker shoots out pylons, you destroy those (usually with your primary, see [Ogris](#primary-ogris) later) and repeat the process
:::

## Prerequisites

To be able to do the Profit-Taker boss in the first place, you need to be max rank with Solaris United and have finished the first three phases of the Profit-Taker heist.

## Gear

### Overview

:::info With Profit-Taker's gimmick being that you can only ever do damage with a given element, the setup looks like this:

- Primary: used either exclusively (Ogris) or mainly (Zenith) for pylons.
- Melee: any Zaw with <b>Exodia Contagion</b> (make sure you can reach 100% crit chance). This is because Contagion turns Zaws into incredibly strong projectile weapons that can both be used very quickly and cover a lot of elements because of how Exodia contagion works, more on that a bit later
- Secondary: any high [crit] damage secondary works, but because of the innate elements on a Contagion Zaw, you want one that has innate magnetic damage (a lich weapon or a Synoid Gammacor). The weapon of choice therefore is [Tenet Diplos](/beginner/vex-armor-builds#tenet-diplos-build). More on the element distribution in a second.
- Archgun: can be used either in hand (see [Mausolon](#archgun-in-hand-mausolon) lower down) or in mech (see [Corvas](#archgun-on-mech-corvas) lower down). The easier option is usually to do mech, since it doesn't leave you in the open during the pull down animation and during the destroying of the legs
:::

:::tip The expected distribution of elements looks like this (taken from [Creating builds](/beginner/creating-builds#shields)):

Secondary: Viral, Heat, innate Mag

Melee (Contagion): Gas, Cold, innate IPS, Blast (innate to Exodia Contagion), Corrosive (covered by Melee Exposure), and Radiation

[__Operator__](/advanced/speedrun-strats.html#operator-element)/Volt Shield: Electric

With this combination, you're only missing Toxin, and there is no way to fit it in the builds without creating the need to switch to your primary.
:::

#### Primary: [Ogris](/beginner/vex-armor-builds#kuva-ogris)

Video demonstration (17&thinsp;mb):
<div style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
<video width="100%" controls>
 <source type="video/mp4" src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/Just%20Use%20The%20Ogris-10.mp4">
</video>
</div>

You should usually only need one shot if your buffs (Vex Armor on Chroma, Eclipse on anything else) are up. The Nightwatch Napalm damage ticks will finish it for you.

The Ogris is the weapon of choice because it's both simple to use and easy to get. You can use either variant, although the Kuva variant is preferred due to it dealing more damage. A very basic but functional build is also <u>shown in the video</u>. For more info about how it works, click [here](/beginner/pogris) and for a proper build with more info, click [here](/beginner/vex-armor-builds#kuva-ogris) or, if you want to get a riven for it (or have one already), [this](/advanced/solo-speedrun-builds#kuva-ogris) might be the build you want.

:::warning ATTENTION:
All the following builds are meant for Chroma only, as Chroma's Vex Armor ability is additive to damage mods so Chroma does not run +damage% mods if he doesn't have to.

For builds for other frames running Eclipse, consult the [Eclipse Builds](/beginner/eclipse-builds) page.
:::

#### Secondary: [Diplos](/beginner/vex-armor-builds#tenet-diplos-build)

![diplers](https://cdn.profit-taker.com/Vex_Armor_Tenet_Diplos_Build.png)

not a lot to be said here, you just shoot between contagion throws. You don't *need* 60% valence, but more always helps.

#### Zaw

Example Build:
![zaw](https://cdn.profit-taker.com/balla_eclipse.png)
Contagion can be unranked, Exposure often needs at least about rank 2. The Zaw Strike of choice is Balla, because it throws at the beginning of the animation, allowing throws in quick succession. Read more about this [here](/beginner/contagion-zaws)

Exodia Contagion is thrown by double jumping, aim gliding, and meleeing. This allows you to shoot your secondary while you fall after throwing your zaw, when you do it quickly.

:::tip
This allows you to not have to think about what elements are on what wepaons, you just spam both weapons until you dont do damage, meaning you are looking at electric or toxin.

Here is a slow demonstration of what the button presses look like (7&thinsp;mb):

Here is a real life example of quickly throwing and shooting (7&thinsp;mb):

 <source type="video/mp4" src="https://cdn.profit-taker.com/Contagion%20Example-3.mp4">
</video>
</div>
I use the scroll wheel to jump and i shoot with 2 in this example. This allows me to do the contagion-shooting-loop very quickly.

#### Archgun in hand: [Mausolon](/beginner/vex-armor-builds#mausolon-build)

![maus](https://cdn.profit-taker.com/Mausolon_Build.png)

Benefits from Warframe buffs such as Vex Armor or Reinforced bond, is limited by long call down animation and ammo economy. If You waste too many bullets, you will have to deal with long cooldowns. That's why this build has Ammo Chain, because the cooldown is based on %ammo used.

#### Archgun on mech: [Corvas <span style="color: red;">(non-Prime)</span>](/beginner/other-builds#corvas-build-non-prime)

![cornbass](https://cdn.profit-taker.com/corvas_mech.png)
Allows You to survive more easily, does not have to deal with cooldowns. Usually slightly more annoying to use because of a higher aiming point and the mech being completely unbuffed.

### Warframe: Chroma

Here is an example build for Chroma (see more [here](/beginner/vex-armor-builds)): 
![chroma build](https://cdn.profit-taker.com/Parasitic_Armor_Vex_Armor.png)
:::info See more build notes [here](/beginner/vex-armor-builds#parasitic-armor)
This build utilizes the Parasitic Armor Helminth Ability to remove shields, making it easier to both stack the Vex Armor damage buff and survive.
- You <u>don't</u> need a triumbral build, this is just an example that helps with survivability. You can also use Adaptation.
- Both the empty slot and VigSwap are flex slots, as VigSwap doesn't actually do much for Chroma, with his Vex Armor ability being the same additive damage multiplier 
- Flex slots can be filled with more strength or duration (e.g. Augur Message/Secrets), or other QoL mods if needed. 
- Arcane Velocity very noticably affects Your secondaries' performance and is therefore a must-get if you are going to invest into farming Profit-Taker, other useful Arcanes include (but are not limited to): Guardian, Awakening, Grace.
:::

For best credit gains, you need at least one [Chroma](/beginner/vex-armor-builds) in your squad. To make sure you actually benefit from it, you might as well run it yourself.

Chroma has the ability to double credits (double dipping with things like credit blessing) by picking up credits in range of his effigy ability, see [How To Place Effigy](https://youtu.be/7-4iw1YjN6A?si=fbrp4014gVYHQHR0) for how you can place it. 
:::warning Attention:
Make sure not to walk away from your Effigy after you have placed it. The credit doubling only works when you are in range (about 10&thinsp;m) of it.
:::

## Other useful stuff

### Intrinsics

In general, you should level up your railjack instrinsics, as this has an effect on a lot of aspects of this fight, mainly: Archwing speed (Piloting r8), Necramech damage (Gunnery r5), pylon damage (gunnery r8) and:

### On-Call Crewmates

One of the most useful tools to help you with Profit-Taker is the On-Call Railjack crewmate. It is free to use after you have bought one from ticker in fortuna, stays for 3 minutes after you have summoned it and it can help you kill enemies around you or cover elements you havent covered (toxin in particular). 

They can have different stats, and the ones you should prioritize are combat, repair and endurance, in that order.  Elite crewmates (unlocked at Command r10) can have additional perk, and you one you want most for efficient runs is the +150%cc buff. It comes in secondary and primary variants and is a bonus additive to other cc mods. Generally speaking, any crewmate with a cc perk is better than one without it.

An ideal Crewmate would look somewhat like this:
![crewmate](https://cdn.profit-taker.com/crew.png)

In terms of weapon choices, as long as it has high damage and is crit-based, it will work somewhat. AoE weapons, or weapons with an AoE damage portion, are usually preferred. Limitations are: some AoE weapons cant do damage to Profit-Taker and can therefore only be used for killing adds (notably: Zarr or Ogris), Crewmates cannot use Incarnon perks or abilities, Rivens, or Arcanes (with a few insignificant expections), and Crewmates cannot use a lot of two-handed weapons like bows, double pistols or throwing weapons (anything rifle or pistol shaped will usually work)

Recommended weapons are (click them to see the builds):

<u>Secondary:</u> [Catabolyst](https://overframe.gg/build/518597/)

<u>Primary:</u> [__Torid__](/advanced/solo-speedrun-builds.html#crewmate-torid), [__Kuva Chakkhurr__](https://overframe.gg/build/626709/), [__Amprex__](https://overframe.gg/build/599307/), [__Synoid Gammacor__](https://overframe.gg/build/626714/)

:::tip Note:
All weapons except Chakkhurr need your Crewmate to be buffed with Vex Armor or Total Eclipse to work well.
:::

### Energy economy

With the provided setup you will quickly notice that you need a lot of energy. With Energy orbs from enemies being an incosistent source of orb drops, we strongly recommend [Energy Restores](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Squad_Energy_Restore). Alternatively, you can run Nourish as your subsume on Chroma, allowing you to make some use of the few energy orbs you get per run. 

The more comfortable setup is to run what the community refers to as "padless" by using [Preparation](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Preparation) and Primed Flow to have a huge reserve of Energy which should last the entire run.

Here is an example Volt build with this philosophy in mind:

![voltpadless](https://cdn.profit-taker.com/voltpadless.png)
[Overframe build](https://overframe.gg/build/396847/)
